# Development Session Log
*Tutorial Implementation & Stage Direction System*

## üìã Session Overview
**Date**: Current Session  
**Focus**: Tutorial dialogue implementation and user interface enhancements  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully Completed  

---

## üéØ Initial Request & Goals

**User Request**: Examine the `/workflow` folder to understand tutorial and early gameplay content, particularly focusing on the first couple days of gameplay/tutorials. Main priorities:
1. Implementing updated dialogue 
2. Integrating activity into physics office exchange with Garcia
3. Aligning current tutorial with updated documentation

---

## üìö Documentation Analysis Phase

### Key Documents Examined:
- `tutorial-flows-conversational.md` - Basic tutorial design with mentor introductions
- `tutorial-flows-development-plan.md` - Implementation roadmap (Phase 1 & 2 complete)
- `tutorial-flows-implementation-context.md` - Technical implementation details
- `narrative-character-context.md` - Character development and Garcia's "Intuitive Healer" role
- `mentor-philosophies.md` - Sophisticated character framework
- `story-character-continuity.md` - Dialogue consistency guidelines

### Critical Findings:
1. **Sophisticated Character Framework**: Documentation showed much more nuanced character development than current implementation
2. **Garcia's Character**: Should use "we" language, emotional check-ins, never explicit philosophy statements
3. **Multi-Character Dynamics**: Established 3-year philosophical debates between colleagues
4. **Authentic Workplace Feel**: Tutorial should feel like real first day, not separate tutorial mode

---

## üîç Current Implementation Issues Identified

### Problems Found:
- ‚ùå **Too Explicit**: Existing tutorial dialogues were "tutorial-y" and breaking immersion
- ‚ùå **One-Dimensional Characters**: Garcia's character lacked sophistication from documentation
- ‚ùå **Missing Dynamics**: No multi-character interactions or established relationships
- ‚ùå **Inauthentic Feel**: Felt like tutorial mode rather than authentic hospital experience

### Character Voice Issues:
- Garcia saying explicit things like "I care about patients" (against guidelines)
- Missing collaborative "we" language
- Lack of natural patient name mentions
- No emotional check-ins ("How are you feeling?")

---

## üí° User Feedback & Course Correction

**User Insight**: "The documentation was much more sophisticated than my initial implementation"

**Additional Documents Provided**:
1. `character_voice_llm_framework.md` - Detailed character identity cards with:
   - Specific verbal habits
   - Emotional triggers  
   - "Things they'd never say" lists
2. `tutorial_dialogue_scripts.md` - Complete authentic tutorial flow with:
   - Multi-character lunch scene
   - Branching paths (Jesse equipment vs Kapoor precision)
   - Natural colleague humor and established relationships

---

## üõ† Implementation Decisions & Solutions

### 1. Garcia's Physics Office Scene Transformation
**Before**: Explicit tutorial language  
**After**: Authentic mentorship with:
- Collaborative "we" language
- Emotional check-ins ("How are you feeling?")
- Patient focus (Mrs. Chen, Mrs. Patterson)
- Natural activity integration

### 2. Multi-Character Lunch Scene Implementation
**Features Added**:
- Jesse and Kapoor's ongoing "machine psychology" vs "quantifiable uncertainties" debate
- Quinn's entrance with "optimization is poetry" exchange
- Natural colleague banter showing 3-year established relationships
- Player choice between Jesse equipment path or Kapoor precision path

### 3. Branching Afternoon Paths
- **Jesse Path**: Equipment troubleshooting with "Bertha's moody" personality approach
- **Kapoor Path**: Systematic measurement science with professional standards focus

### 4. Quinn's Office Journal Introduction
- Mystery-over-exposition approach
- No explicit game mechanic explanations
- Natural discovery of Amara's journal

### 5. Character Voice Improvements
- **Garcia**: "We" language, emotional check-ins, patient names, collaborative
- **Quinn**: Visible excitement about patterns, "What if" language, scientific enthusiasm  
- **Jesse**: Equipment anthropomorphization, practical solutions, hands-on
- **Kapoor**: Systematic language, acknowledges other approaches while maintaining precision

## üé≠ Stage Direction System Implementation

### Problem Identified:
Action descriptions like `[Player enters cafeteria]` were mixed in with dialogue text, breaking immersion.

### Solution Implemented:
**Stage Direction Parser System**:
- **Automatic Parsing**: Extracts text in `[brackets]` from dialogue
- **Separate Display**: Shows as italicized stage directions above dialogue
- **Clean Dialogue**: Removes bracketed text from main dialogue flow
- **Movie Script Style**: Professional formatting with subtle styling

### Visual Design:
```
‚Äª Player enters cafeteria after Garcia activity
‚Äª Jesse says mid-bite of sandwich, talking to Kapoor

"...so I told maintenance it's not broken, it just has opinions."
```

### Technical Implementation:
- `parseDialogueText()` function with regex extraction
- Styled components for stage directions
- Integration with existing typing animation system
- Maintains clean separation of concerns

---

## üè• Cafeteria Room Addition

### Implementation:
- **Location**: Left and down from physics office (x: 18, y: 42)
- **Icon**: üçΩÔ∏è (dining and team gathering)
- **Mentor**: Quinn organizes the lunch scene
- **Tutorial Integration**: Recommended room for lunch dialogue
- **Map Integration**: Added to ROOM_AREAS array with proper positioning

### Tutorial System Updates:
- Added cafeteria to tutorial dialogue mapping
- Set as recommended room for lunch step
- Integrated with existing room availability system
