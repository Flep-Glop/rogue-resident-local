## VERSION INFORMATION
**Last Updated:** April 14, 2025  
**Status:** Vertical Slice Development  
**Document Version:** 2.1

> This document serves as the single source of truth for Rogue Resident's game design. All prior design documents should be considered superseded by this version.

## PART 1: GAME OVERVIEW & CORE MECHANICS

### 1.1 Game Concept

**Game Title:** Rogue Resident  
**Tagline:** "The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a constellation to be illuminated."

**High Concept:**  
Rogue Resident is an educational roguelike game that transforms medical physics education into a narrative-driven experience where expertise development is visualized as a growing constellation of interconnected knowledge. Players navigate hospital "floors," encountering challenges that mirror authentic professional development, while alternating between day phase (active learning) and night phase (reflection and connection).

**Target Audience:**  
- Primary: Medical physics students and residents
- Secondary: Medical physics professionals seeking continued education
- Tertiary: Individuals interested in the field or similar technical domains

**Educational Philosophy:**  
The game's core philosophical approach reframes learning from linear accumulation to interconnected synthesis. Rather than treating knowledge as isolated facts to be memorized, Rogue Resident models the development of expertise as a process of:
1. Exposure to concepts in authentic contexts
2. Practice applying knowledge in varied scenarios
3. Connection of related concepts to form patterns
4. Synthesis of concepts to solve novel problems
5. Mastery through intuitive understanding

### 1.2 Core Game Loop

**Day/Night Cycle Structure:**

#### Day Phase (Hospital Challenges)
Players navigate the hospital as a medical physics resident, encountering various challenge nodes:
- **Clinical Nodes:** Patient cases requiring treatment planning decisions
- **QA Nodes:** Equipment calibration and quality assurance challenges
- **Educational Nodes:** Concept explanations and knowledge synthesis
- **Storage/Treasure:** Discover tools and references
- **Qualification Nodes:** Tests of understanding required for progression
- **Boss Encounters:** Synthesis of multiple concepts to overcome major challenges
- **Mentor Side Quests:** Optional challenges with narrative depth that provide special abilities for boss encounters

During the day phase, players:
1. Navigate the hospital floor (fixed layout for vertical slice, eventually procedurally-generated)
2. Select challenge nodes to engage with
3. Interact with mentor characters through dialogue
4. Answer questions and solve problems to gain insight and momentum
5. Use special abilities (Tangent, Reframe, Peer-Review, Boast)
6. Build relationships with mentors
7. Progress toward floor boss encounters

#### Night Phase (Knowledge Constellation)
Players return to their hill home overlooking the hospital to reflect on knowledge gained:
1. View concepts learned during the day as stars in a night sky constellation
2. Form connections between related concepts
3. Review journal entries
4. Observe mastery progress across different knowledge domains
5. Prepare for the next day's challenges

**Resource Systems:**

1. **Momentum System (Short-term Tactical Resource)**
   - Visualized as ⚡ Pips (0-3 levels)
   - Accumulation Method: Consecutive correct answers
   - Benefits: Unlocks advanced dialogue options, multiplies insight gains
   - Risk Profile: Resets upon incorrect answers, creating push-your-luck tension
   - When fully charged, enables "Boast" for high-risk, high-reward interactions

## PART 5: TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION & ROADMAP

### 5.1 Architecture Overview

Rogue Resident implements a hybrid architecture combining reactive state management with event-driven communication patterns. This approach allows for a balance between deterministic state transitions and flexible component interactions, crucial for managing the complexity of an educational roguelike.

**Design Pillars:**
1. **Domain-Driven State Isolation:** Separate stores for distinct concerns
2. **Centralized Event Communication:** Single event bus pattern for cross-cutting concerns
3. **Deterministic State Machines:** Formalized transitions for critical flows
4. **Progressive Disclosure UI:** Components that reveal complexity as the player learns
5. **Chamber Pattern Optimization:** Performance-focused animation and state management

**Core Systems Architecture:**
- **Knowledge Constellation System:** Graph-based concept representation
- **Game State Machine:** Core game loop management with phase transitions
- **Dialogue State Machine:** Character interaction with branching conversation flows
- **Event System:** Centralized bus for cross-cutting communication
- **Journal System:** Player progress and knowledge tracking

### 5.2 Knowledge Constellation System

**Key Abstractions:**

The constellation system uses a composite pattern where nodes (concepts) and edges (connections) together form a navigable knowledge graph. Domain-specific knowledge is encoded in the relationships between concepts:

```typescript
// Core concept representation
export interface ConceptNode {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  domain: KnowledgeDomain;
  description: string;
  mastery: number; // 0-100%
  connections: string[];
  prerequisites: string[];
  discovered: boolean;
  position?: { x: number; y: number };
}

// Connection between concepts
export interface ConceptConnection {
  source: string;
  target: string;
  strength: number;
  discovered: boolean;
}
```

**Implementation Pattern:**

```typescript
// Example of mastery update function with diminishing returns
function updateMastery(node, amount) {
  // Growth slows as mastery approaches 100
  const newMastery = amount > 0
    ? node.mastery + (amount * (1 - (node.mastery / 120)))
    : node.mastery - (Math.abs(amount) * (node.mastery / 120));
      
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(100, newMastery));
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- **Day Phase:** Knowledge is gained through challenges and dialogue
- **Night Phase:** Knowledge visualization and connection formation
- **Character Interactions:** Teaching styles affect knowledge gain rate
- **Challenge Difficulty:** Adapts based on mastery of relevant concepts

### 5.3 Game State Machine

The game state machine manages the core game loop and phase transitions with a formal state machine, ensuring reliable gameplay flow:

**Key States:**
- **not_started:** Initial state showing title screen
- **in_progress:** Active gameplay with phase substates
- **game_over:** Player has lost
- **victory:** Player has won

**Phases (during in_progress):**
- **day:** Hospital challenge gameplay
- **night:** Knowledge constellation visualization
- **transition_to_day/transition_to_night:** Visual transition states

**Implementation Pattern:**

```typescript
// Define valid state transitions
const VALID_STATE_TRANSITIONS: Record<GameState, GameState[]> = {
  'not_started': ['in_progress'],
  'in_progress': ['game_over', 'victory'],
  'game_over': ['not_started', 'in_progress'],
  'victory': ['not_started', 'in_progress'],
};

// State transition with validation
transitionToState: (newState: GameState, reason?: string): boolean => {
  const currentState = get().gameState;
    
  // Validate transition
  if (!VALID_STATE_TRANSITIONS[currentState].includes(newState)) {
    console.error(`Invalid state transition: ${currentState} -> ${newState}`);
    return false;
  }
    
  // Update state
  set({ gameState: newState });
    
  return true;
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- **Map Generation:** New map on day phase start (fixed for vertical slice)
- **Challenge System:** Active during day phase
- **Constellation View:** Active during night phase
- **Meta-progression:** Updates between day/night cycles

### 5.4 Dialogue State Machine

Handles character interactions with branching conversation flows, ensuring narrative consistency and progression guarantees:

**Key Abstractions:**

```typescript
// Dialogue flow state
export interface DialogueState {
  id: string;
  type: DialogueStateType;
  text?: string;
  options?: DialogueOption[];
  nextStateId?: string;
  isConclusion?: boolean;
  isCriticalPath?: boolean;
  onEnter?: (context: DialogueContext) => void;
  onExit?: (context: DialogueContext) => void;
}

// Context shared across dialogue flow
export interface DialogueContext {
  characterId: string;
  nodeId: string;
  playerScore: number;
  selectedOptionIds: string[];
  knowledgeGained: Record<string, number>;
  visitedStateIds: string[];
  criticalPathProgress: Record<string, boolean>;
  transactionIds: Record<string, string>;
}
```

**Challenge Question Structure:**
Each question in a challenge has three components:
- **Content:** The specific concept being tested (swappable via Tangent ability)
- **Context:** The frame of reference or application scenario (changeable via Reframe ability)
- **Mentor:** The character presenting the question (can be changed with Peer-Review ability)

**Implementation Pattern:**

A directed graph with nodes (dialogue states) and edges (transitions based on player choices), with special handling for critical path progression.

**Integration Points:**
- **Character Teaching Styles:** Influences dialogue options and responses
- **Knowledge Gain:** Dialogue choices affect concept mastery
- **Relationship Building:** Player choices impact mentor relationships
- **Critical Progression:** Ensures key narrative moments occur

### 5.5 Event System

Centralized event bus for cross-cutting communication between systems, supporting decoupled architecture:

**Key Abstractions:**

```typescript
// Event type definitions
export enum GameEventType {
  // Session events
  SESSION_STARTED = 'session:started',
    
  // Node events
  NODE_COMPLETED = 'node:completed',
    
  // Dialogue events
  DIALOGUE_COMPLETED = 'dialogue:completed',
  DIALOGUE_CRITICAL_PATH = 'dialogue:critical:path',
    
  // Knowledge events
  KNOWLEDGE_GAINED = 'knowledge:gained',
    
  // Journal events
  JOURNAL_ACQUIRED = 'progression:journal:acquired',
    
  // And many others...
}

// Base event interface
export interface GameEvent<T = any> {
  type: GameEventType;
  payload: T;
  timestamp: number;
  source?: string;
  id?: string;
}
```

**Implementation Pattern:**

A publish-subscribe pattern with type-safe event definitions and centralized logging:

```typescript
// Event dispatch with logging
dispatch: <T>(type: GameEventType, payload: T, source?: string) => {
  const event: GameEvent<T> = {
    type,
    payload,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    source: source || 'unknown',
    id: `${Date.now()}-${Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 9)}`
  };
    
  // Log the event
  set(state => ({
    eventLog: [...state.eventLog.slice(-1000), event]
  }));
    
  // Notify listeners
  const listeners = get().listeners.get(type);
  if (listeners) {
    listeners.forEach(listener => {
      try {
        listener(event);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error in event listener for ${type}:`, error);
      }
    });
  }
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- **Cross-System Communication:** Decoupled messaging between stores
- **Progression Tracking:** Ensures progress is properly recorded
- **Debug Tracing:** Centralized event history for troubleshooting
- **Analytics:** Hooks for player behavior tracking

### 5.6 Journal System

Tracks player progress and knowledge through an in-game journal that evolves over time:

**Key Abstractions:**

```typescript
export type JournalEntry = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  date: string;
  content: string;
  tags: string[];
  relatedConcepts?: string[];
};

export type JournalUpgrade = 
  | 'base'       // Basic notebook
  | 'technical'  // Technical upgrade
  | 'annotated'  // Special upgrade
  | 'indexed'    // Better organization
  | 'integrated'; // Special references
```

**Implementation Pattern:**

A persisted store with tiered upgrade path, representing the player's developing research skills:

```typescript
// Initialize with proper persistence
export const useJournalStore = create<JournalState>()(
  persist(
    (set, get) => ({
      // Initial state
      hasJournal: false,
      currentUpgrade: 'base',
      entries: [],
      // ... actions ...
    }),
    {
      name: 'rogue-resident-journal',
      storage: createJSONStorage(() => localStorage),
      partialize: (state) => ({
        // Only persist these keys
        hasJournal: state.hasJournal,
        currentUpgrade: state.currentUpgrade,
        entries: state.entries,
        // ... other persisted keys ...
      }),
    }
  )
);
```

**Integration Points:**
- **Knowledge Tracking:** Records concept discoveries during gameplay
- **Character Notes:** Logs relationship development with mentors
- **Progression Milestone:** Acquisition is a key narrative moment
- **UI Hub:** Provides central access to player knowledge

### 5.7 Chamber Pattern Implementation

The Chamber Pattern is a critical performance optimization technique for animation and state updates:

**Core Principles:**
1. **Primitive Value Extraction:** Extract only primitive values from stores
2. **Stable Function References:** Maintain stable callbacks across renders
3. **DOM-Based Animation:** Move animations outside React's render cycle
4. **Atomic State Updates:** Group related state changes
5. **Defensive Programming:** Guard operations against component unmounting

**Implementation Example:**
```typescript
// Animation using Chamber Pattern
function StarPulseEffect({ masteryLevel, isActive }) {
  // DOM refs for direct manipulation
  const starRef = useRef(null);
  const mountedRef = useRef(true);
  const timerRef = useRef(null);
  
  // Track mount status
  useEffect(() => {
    mountedRef.current = true;
    return () => {
      mountedRef.current = false;
      if (timerRef.current) clearTimeout(timerRef.current);
    };
  }, []);
  
  // Extract only primitive values
  const isFocused = usePrimitiveStoreValue(
    useUIStore,
    state => state.focusedStarId === id,
    false
  );
  
  // Stable animation callback
  const pulseStar = useStableCallback(() => {
    if (!starRef.current || !mountedRef.current) return;
    
    // Direct DOM manipulation instead of React state
    starRef.current.classList.add('pulse-animation');
    
    // Clean up after animation
    timerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      if (starRef.current && mountedRef.current) {
        starRef.current.classList.remove('pulse-animation');
      }
    }, 2000);
  }, []);
  
  // Apply visual effects
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!starRef.current || !mountedRef.current) return;
    
    // Only high-mastery stars pulse
    if (masteryLevel > 75 && isActive) {
      // Staggered animation start
      timerRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
        pulseStar();
        
        // Interval for repeating pulse
        const interval = setInterval(pulseStar, 8000);
        timerRef.current = interval;
        
        return () => clearInterval(interval);
      }, Math.random() * 2000);
    }
  }, [masteryLevel, isActive, pulseStar]);
  
  return (
    <div 
      ref={starRef} 
      className={`star mastery-${Math.floor(masteryLevel / 25) * 25}`}
    />
  );
}
```

**Application Areas:**
- Constellation star animations
- Day/night transitions
- Ability activation effects
- Connection formation visualizations
- Shooting star animations

### 5.8 Implementation of Simplified Pattern Recognition

For the vertical slice, pattern recognition is simplified to focus on pre-defined patterns:

```typescript
// Simplified pattern definition
export interface ConstellationPattern {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  requiredStarIds: string[]; // Exact stars needed
  optionalStarIds?: string[]; // Optional bonus stars
  reward: {
    sp: number;
    insightBonus?: number;
  };
}

// Simple pattern detection
export function detectPatterns(
  discoveredStarIds: string[],
  formedConnectionIds: string[]
): string[] {
  const detectedPatternIds: string[] = [];
  
  // Check each pattern
  Object.entries(PATTERNS).forEach(([patternId, pattern]) => {
    // Must have all required stars
    const hasAllRequiredStars = pattern.requiredStarIds.every(
      id => discoveredStarIds.includes(id)
    );
    
    if (hasAllRequiredStars) {
      detectedPatternIds.push(patternId);
    }
  });
  
  return detectedPatternIds;
}
```

This approach focuses on functionality over complex geometric pattern detection for the vertical slice.
