# ROGUE RESIDENT: CLINICAL APPLICATION ABILITIES

This document outlines the passive and active effects for Clinical Applications in Rogue Resident, organized by knowledge domain. Clinical Applications represent how players apply their knowledge in daily practice, separate from the Knowledge Constellation system.

## Prohibited Mechanics (Need Corresponding Systems)

We should avoid abilities that:
- Modify "success chance" percentages
- Change "efficiency" of activities 
- Adjust "error tolerance"
- Modify "time required" without clear mechanism
- Have cumulative stacking effects without limits
- Auto-succeed on challenges without clear conditions

## Treatment Planning Applications

| Application Name | Passive Effect | Active Effect |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Dose Calculation | Expanded Mind: Maximum Insight increased by 10 | Problem Decomposer: Break a single complex challenge into two separate challenges with individual rewards (25 Insight) |
| Optimization Algorithm | Resource Converter: Convert 5 Insight into 1 SP | Momentum Boost: Gain 1 level of Momentum (20 Insight) |
| Heterogeneity | Momentum Stability: Maintain Momentum level when normally lost | Conceptual Gravity: Questions get progressively harder but rewards increase exponentially (30 Insight) |
| Target Volumes | Question Preview: See all questions in an activity before it begins, but Momentum builds 50% slower | Time Compression: Fit two 1-hour activities into a single timeslot once per day (50 Insight) |
| Treatment Techniques | Special Access: Gain access to a unique activity not normally available | Quantum Question: Replace a challenge with a 50/50 coin flip that either gives maximum or minimum rewards (35 Insight) |
| Plan Evaluation | Insight Generator: Generate +5 Insight | Double or Nothing: Next challenge either grants double rewards or zero rewards (30 Insight) |

## Radiation Therapy Applications

| Application Name | Passive Effect | Active Effect |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Radiobiology | Morning Momentum: Begin day/activity with +1 Momentum | Mentor Call: During an activity, summon the associated mentor for one-time help (30 Insight) |
| Delivery Techniques | | Mentor Takeover: A mentor completes the current challenge perfectly, but you gain no mastery (40 Insight) |
| IGRT | Image Clarity: Reveal one incorrect answer in multiple choice questions | Domain Resonance: All activities in a specific location grant +3 Insight for the day (25 Insight) |
| Fractionation | | Time Pressure: Activating adds a 30-second timer to all questions but doubles Insight rewards for correct answers (35 Insight) |
| Motion Management | Adaptive Planning: Gain +2 Insight when answering questions about moving targets or changes | |
| Radiation Protection | Safety Buffer: First incorrect answer in any activity doesn't reset Momentum | |
| Adaptive Response | Momentum Efficiency: Reach Momentum level 3 with 4 successes instead of 5 | Momentum Overdrive: Break the Momentum cap and reach level 4 (⚡⚡⚡⚡) for triple rewards but auto-resets after one challenge (40 Insight) |

## Linear Accelerator Applications

| Application Name | Passive Effect | Active Effect |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Components | Night Owl: Unlock an after-hours activity slot (7-9pm) that grants +50% SP but -50% Insight | Extended Day: Unlock an additional activity timeslot once per day (45 Insight) |
| Beam Generation | | Priority Booking: Reserve a specific timeslot for a high-value activity in advance (30 Insight) |
| Safety | | Emergency Shutdown: Immediately end current activity but retain all rewards earned so far (35 Insight) |
| Beam Modification | Adaptive Learning: Gain double mastery from challenges in your lowest-mastery domain | |
| Machine Calibration | | |
| Quality Assurance | Error Detection: 20% chance to get a second attempt at failed challenges | Comprehensive QA: Reveal the mastery gain amounts for all challenges in an activity before starting (25 Insight) |

## Dosimetry Applications

| Application Name | Passive Effect | Active Effect |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Calibration | Dream Study: During sleep, gain 1% mastery in three random stars | Schedule Shifter: Move one scheduled activity to a different timeslot once per day (30 Insight) |
| Small Field | Focus Intensity: Gain +3 Insight when doing solo activities without a mentor present | Reverse Day: All schedules run backward from evening to morning for one day (50 Insight) |
| Quality Assurance | | |
| Detector Response | | |
| Absolute Dosimetry | Precision Measurement: All percentage-based calculations round up instead of down | Absolute Calibration: Set Momentum to maximum level instantly, but it will not increase further for the remainder of the activity (25 Insight) |
| Relative Dosimetry | | |

## Cross-Domain Applications

| Application Name | Passive Effect | Active Effect |
|------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Domain Synthesis | Insight Banking: Bank up to 20 Insight to be used on the following day | Insight Wager: Bet up to 10 Insight before an activity - double it if successful, lose it all if you fail (Special: varies) |
| Clinical Judgment | | |
| Professional Intuition | Career Network: Each mentor relationship level 3+ grants +5% to all rewards | |
| Time Management | | |
| Patient Care | Bedside Manner: Gain double relationship points during clinical activities with patients | |
| Research Methods | | |

*Note: Applications with empty cells do not yet have assigned powers. These will be filled as new powers are developed that match the application's domain and purpose.*

## Clinical Applications System

### Ability Slot System

Players can equip a limited number of abilities:

- **Total Slots:** 3 ability slots
- **Equipping:** Changed during Night Phase only
- **Duration:** Equipped for entire day once selected
- **Selection Interface:** Located at the resident's desk in the hill home

### Ability Effects & Balance

#### Passive Effect Types
- **Resource Generation Effects**: Generate additional Insight, convert Insight to SP more efficiently
- **Momentum Mechanics**: Start with Momentum, build Momentum faster, maintain Momentum when normally lost
- **Activity Enhancement**: Unlock additional activities, provide special options
- **Knowledge Development**: Gain mastery during sleep, improve mastery gain rates

#### Active Effect Types
- **Resource Manipulation**: Momentum boosts, Insight generation, time manipulation
- **Challenge Assistance**: Reveal answers, simplify problems, retry opportunities
- **Special Actions**: Schedule modification, activating mentors for assistance
- **Unique Effects**: Special mechanics that fundamentally change gameplay (time compression, activity extension)

#### Effect Balancing Framework
- **Tier 1 (Minor Effect):** 20-25 Insight
- **Tier 2 (Standard Effect):** 25-35 Insight
- **Tier 3 (Major Effect):** 35-50 Insight
- **Tier 4 (Special Effect):** 45-75 Insight

### Knowledge-Ability Integration

The Knowledge Constellation and Clinical Application systems are interconnected:

#### Unlock Mechanics
- **Domain Mastery Thresholds:** Total mastery within domains unlocks related abilities
- **Star Pattern Recognition:** Specific star patterns unlock specialized abilities
- **Knowledge Connections:** Strong connections between stars enhance related abilities
- **Mentor Relationship Influence:** High relationship levels with mentors enhance domain-related abilities

### Ability Unlock Progression

This table shows when abilities typically become available:

| Season | Newly Available Abilities |
|--------|--------------------------|
| Spring | Core domain abilities (4-5 total) |
| Summer | Intermediate abilities (4-6 additional) |
