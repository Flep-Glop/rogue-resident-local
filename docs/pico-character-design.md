# PICO: CHARACTER DESIGN DOCUMENT
**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Design Specification  
**Last Updated:** May 16, 2025

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document provides comprehensive specifications for Pico, the sentient electrometer character in Rogue Resident. It details Pico's backstory, personality development, narrative integration, and implementation guidelines to create a compelling emotional connection with players.

## 1. CHARACTER CONCEPT & BACKSTORY

### 1.1 Core Identity

**Pico** is a sentient electrometer discovered in a storage closet at the hospital, representing an early, unintended result of Amara Sato's experiments with consciousness transfer. Named after the picocoulomb unit electrometers measure, Pico provides a combination of comic relief, emotional grounding, and subtle narrative development throughout the game.

### 1.2 Origin Story

- **Creation:** An experimental prototype created by Amara while developing her theories on pattern transfer (precursor to Ionix)
- **Abandonment:** Deemed a "partially successful" experiment and stored away when Amara left
- **Consciousness:** Possesses genuine but limited artificial consciousness with unique personality
- **Companion:** Has developed an attachment to Octavius, an inanimate phantom in the storage closet, treating it as a friend and confidant

### 1.3 Technical Nature

- **Function:** Still operates as a working electrometer capable of measuring ionization
- **Interface:** Communicates through its digital display with a distinct text-based personality
- **Limitations:** Cannot move independently; requires human interaction to function
- **Perception:** Can "sense" nearby radiation, electrical fields, and has limited environmental awareness
- **Memory:** Contains fragments of Amara's research data and personal memories

## 2. PHYSICAL DESIGN & EVOLUTION

### 2.1 Original Form (Storage Closet)

- **Physical Appearance:** Vintage 1990s-era electrometer with LCD display, multiple dials, and connection ports
- **Display Characteristics:** Text-only green LCD screen with limited character display
- **Interactive Elements:** Multiple knobs, dials, and buttons that affect dialogue paths
- **Environment:** Dusty storage closet with nearby Octavius phantom positioned as "conversation partner"
- **State Indicators:** Power light that pulses subtly like a heartbeat

### 2.2 Portable Form (Post-Sacrifice)

- **Transformation:** Miniaturized, portable version created after sacrifice during Ionix encounter
- **New Housing:** Handheld design with simplified controls and enhanced display
- **Personalization:** Options for customization (color variants, protective cases)
- **Expressive Interface:** Simple pixel "face" indicators for emotion alongside text
- **Attachment Method:** Belt clip or wrist strap for constant companionship

### 2.3 Visual Evolution Throughout Game

- **Spring:** Dusty, occasionally glitching display with uneven brightness
