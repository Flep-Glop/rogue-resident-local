- **Card Distribution:**
  - **Direct Star Unlocks:** 21 cards (from non-core stars)
  - **Etching Pattern Unlocks:** 3 cards (cross-domain)
  - **Core Star Cards:** 0 (core stars don't grant cards)
  - **Missing/Incomplete:** 2 cards need passive effects, 4 need active effects

### 1.2 Journal Integration

The Applications and Etching systems are physically represented through the player's journal:

- **Journal Location:** Study desk in hill home

  - **Applications Collection:** Pages storing collected cards
  - **Card Slots:** Three physical slots/pockets for equipped cards
  - **Etching Catalog:** Pages documenting found etchings
  - **Mastery Notes:** Progress tracking by domain
  - **Discovery Log:** Record of when/where items were found

### 1.3 Progressive System Introduction

To avoid overwhelming players, cards are introduced gradually:

- **Days 1-2:** Dr. Garcia & RT domain only
- **Days 3-4:** Dr. Quinn & TP domain added  
- **Days 5-6:** Technician Jesse & LA domain added
- **Days 7-8:** Dr. Kapoor & DOS domain added

This creates a natural tutorial flow with manageable card acquisition (1-2 per week).
