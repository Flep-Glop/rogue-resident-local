- **cleanup**: Memory management for animation lifecycle


**Data Flow:**

- **Input**: Triggered by dialogue choice effects


- **Output**: Visual feedback enhancing user experience




**Special Implementation Notes:**

- **auto_triggering**: Insight gains (+) → 💡 + bounce, losses (-) → ? + shake

- **symbol_types**: !, ?, ..., 💡, ⭐ with unique animations

- **animation_separation**: Positioning transforms separate from animation transforms



---

### Challenge Dialogue System

**Role in System**: Educational activities with social context  
**Implementation Priority**: content_expansion  
**Current Status**: implemented_and_working



**Technical Requirements:**

- **compact_portraits**: Smaller, animated character displays

- **text_feed**: Twitter-like challenge progression display

- **reaction_system**: Real-time mentor reactions to player performance

- **progress_tracking**: Visual indication of challenge completion

- **result_integration**: Seamless flow to reward/progression systems


**Data Flow:**

- **Input**: Activated by room_transition for challenge activities


- **Output**: Returns results to activity-framework for rewards


- **Dependencies**: Challenge content, mentor personalities, player stats



**Special Implementation Notes:**

- **mentor_reactions**: Different mentors react differently to player choices

- **dynamic_encouragement**: Adaptive support based on performance

- **clear_mode_distinction**: Visually distinct from narrative dialogue

## 🔧 IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS

### Data Flow Architecture

```
hospital_backdrop -> room_transition: room_id, activity_type, player_state
```

```
room_transition -> dialogue_systems: activity_content, mentor_context
```

```
dialogue_systems -> activity_framework: completion_data, choices_made
```

```
activity_framework -> game_state: rewards, relationship_changes, progress
```


### Shared System Dependencies

- Game state management (save/load)

- Audio system (music, sound effects)

- Input handling (mouse, keyboard)

- Performance monitoring (FPS, memory)


### Error Prevention Checklist

- [ ] Prevent: Inconsistent state between components

- [ ] Prevent: Asset loading blocking user interaction

- [ ] Prevent: Memory leaks from frequent transitions

- [ ] Prevent: Broken integration when one component changes
