## üîó How It Connects to Everything Else


**This system works with** (see references/ folder for full details):


- **activity-framework** - provides the actual activities and rewards

- **visual-design** - defines the art style and feel

- **game-constants** - connects to overall game mechanics


**Integration philosophy**: Each component passes exactly what the next one needs, no more, no less. Clean handoffs = no confusion later.

## üí° Key Design Decisions to Discuss


**Questions that need team input**:

- **Dialogue_interaction_system**: Requires integration with main dialogue framework



**Ready to move forward on**:

- **Mentor_character_system**: Complete character definitions available with full personality profiles

- **Relationship_progression_system**: Clear progression mechanics defined with level thresholds

## üé≠ Character Integration

**The mentors in this system**:
- **Dr. Garcia** - Warm, patient-focused dialogue 
- **Dr. Quinn** - Analytical, inspiring conversations
- **Jesse Martinez** - Direct, practical discussions
- **Dr. Kapoor** - Precise, methodical interactions

Each mentor's personality shines through both the narrative dialogue (story conversations) and challenge dialogue (learning reactions).

---

## üåü What Makes This Exciting

**The layered dialogue concept** - text boxes that fade and layer back, letting players review conversation history by clicking back

**Clear mode distinction** - players never wonder "am I in story mode or challenge mode?" 

**Asset-driven development** - we create the visual feel first, then build the tech to support it

**Integration without patchwork** - each component has clear inputs/outputs, preventing future headaches

---

## üéØ Next Steps for Team Discussion

1. **Review the blocking items above** - what's our approach?
2. **Asset prioritization** - does the week-by-week plan feel right?
3. **Technical unknown resolution** - schedule collaborative sessions for complex decisions
4. **Character voice consistency** - how do mentors feel different in narrative vs challenge modes?
