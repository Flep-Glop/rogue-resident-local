# Tutorial Flow and Dialogue System - Design Discussion

> **What we're building**: Structured tutorial sequences, dialogue examples, and narrative transitions  
> **Core philosophy**: Seamless introduction to complex systems through narrative integration  
> **Why it matters**: Seamless learning through narrative-driven discovery

## üéÆ The Player Experience

### What Players Will Do


**Game Introduction**  
Player starts first day and meets mentors
- Player actions: Listen to mentor introductions, Make dialogue choices, Observe hospital environment


**First Activities**  
Player participates in guided learning activities
- Player actions: Answer tutorial questions, Gain insight points, Unlock first ability


**Evening Reflection**  
Player explores constellation and journal systems
- Player actions: Unlock first star, Place ability in journal, Prepare for next day



### Why This Flow Matters
The **Seamless introduction to complex systems through narrative integration** ensures players always understand what mode they're in - whether they're exploring, learning story context, or being challenged academically.

---

## üéØ Design Goals & Current Status

**Where we are**: Comprehensive tutorial sequences defined, integration with game systems needed  
**What we're deciding**: Tutorial pacing and narrative integration implementation  
**Success looks like**: Players understand core mechanics within first 30 minutes of gameplay

**Our constraint**: Must introduce complex systems without overwhelming new players - and that's exactly why this modular approach works!

## üèóÔ∏è The Four Key Components


### First Day Tutorial Sequence
*Initial game introduction and mentor meetings*

**The experience**: Initial game introduction and mentor meetings  
**Development status**: clear_requirements

### Night Phase Introduction
*Knowledge constellation and journal system introduction*

**The experience**: Knowledge constellation and journal system introduction  
**Development status**: clear_requirements

## üé® The Asset Vision

**Week 1 Focus**: Tutorial overlay UI elements and progress indicators

**Key visuals we need**:

**Ui_elements**:

- Tutorial overlay designs with clear visual hierarchy

- Progress indicators showing tutorial completion

- Interactive hotspots for clickable tutorial elements

- Phone call UI for mentor guidance during night phase


**Visual_assets**:

- Hospital orientation tour backgrounds

- Mentor introduction portrait variations

- Knowledge constellation tutorial overlays

- Journal card placement visual guides


**Audio**:

- Tutorial progression success sounds

- Mentor guidance audio cues

- First day completion celebration audio



**The progression**: Each week builds on the last, so by week 4 we have "Polish, accessibility, and tutorial completion celebrations"

## üîó How It Connects to Everything Else



**This system works with**:




**Integration philosophy**: Each component passes exactly what the next one needs, no more, no less. Clean handoffs = no confusion later.

## üí° Key Design Decisions to Discuss



**Ready to move forward on**:

- **First_day_tutorial**: Complete dialogue sequences defined, ready for implementation

- **Night_phase_tutorial**: Knowledge constellation system exists, needs tutorial guidance

## üéì Tutorial Narrative Flow


**First Day Journey** - The complete onboarding experience:


**08:00 - Morning arrival**

- Location: hospital_entrance with dr_garcia


- Goals: Establish Setting, Introduce First Mentor, Provide Initial Agency


- Sample Dialogue: "You must be our new resident! I'm Dr. Garcia, lead radiation oncologist. Welcome to Westview!..."



**10:30 - First educational activity**





**12:15 - Lunch break dialogue**


- Goals: Introduce Second Mentor, Foreshadow Constellation System, Build Anticipation


- Sample Dialogue: "Mind if I join? You must be the new resident! I'm Dr. Quinn, head of Treatment Planning...."



**14:30 - First ability introduction**





**17:15 - Night phase transition**


- Goals: Introduce Third Mentor, Explain Night Phase Purpose, Create Smooth Transition







**Night Phase Introduction** - Transitioning to reflection:


**19:30 - Observatory introduction**

- Setting: hill_home_observatory guided by dr_quinn


- Method: Phone call



**20:15 - Journal system introduction**

- Setting: hill_home_study guided by dr_garcia


- Method: Text message



**21:30 - Sleep transition**






**Design Philosophy**: The tutorial isn't a separate experience - it's your first day at the hospital with mentors who care about your learning.



## üé≠ Character Integration

**The mentors in this system**:
- **Dr. Garcia** - Warm, patient-focused dialogue 
- **Dr. Quinn** - Analytical, inspiring conversations
- **Jesse Martinez** - Direct, practical discussions
- **Dr. Kapoor** - Precise, methodical interactions

Each mentor's personality shines through both the narrative dialogue (story conversations) and challenge dialogue (learning reactions).

---

## üåü What Makes This Exciting

**The layered dialogue concept** - text boxes that fade and layer back, letting players review conversation history by clicking back

**Clear mode distinction** - players never wonder "am I in story mode or challenge mode?" 

**Asset-driven development** - we create the visual feel first, then build the tech to support it

**Integration without patchwork** - each component has clear inputs/outputs, preventing future headaches

---

## üéØ Next Steps for Team Discussion

1. **Review the blocking items above** - what's our approach?
2. **Asset prioritization** - does the week-by-week plan feel right?
3. **Technical unknown resolution** - schedule collaborative sessions for complex decisions
4. **Character voice consistency** - how do mentors feel different in narrative vs challenge modes?
