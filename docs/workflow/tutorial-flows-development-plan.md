## üîó INTEGRATION STRATEGY (Anti-Patchwork)

### **Data Flow Architecture**

game_start -> first_day_tutorial: new_player_state, initial_mentors

tutorial_completion -> main_game: unlocked_abilities, mentor_relationships

day_completion -> night_tutorial: learning_progress, available_stars

night_completion -> next_day: equipped_abilities, progression_state


### **Shared Dependencies** (Plan for these)

- Mentor character data and dialogue content

- Activity framework for tutorial questions

- Knowledge constellation for star unlock tutorials

- Journal system for ability management tutorials


### **üí• FAILURE MODES TO PREVENT**

- Tutorial sequences that overwhelm new players

- Incomplete tutorial state causing confusion

- Tutorial progression blocking main game access

- Inconsistent mentor personality in tutorial vs main game


### **ÔøΩÔøΩ Testing Strategy**
