## üîß IMPLEMENTATION PATTERNS

### Data Flow Architecture

```
game_start -> first_day_tutorial: new_player_state, initial_mentors
```

```
tutorial_completion -> main_game: unlocked_abilities, mentor_relationships
```

```
day_completion -> night_tutorial: learning_progress, available_stars
```

```
night_completion -> next_day: equipped_abilities, progression_state
```


### Shared System Dependencies

- Mentor character data and dialogue content

- Activity framework for tutorial questions

- Knowledge constellation for star unlock tutorials

- Journal system for ability management tutorials


### Error Prevention Checklist

- [ ] Prevent: Tutorial sequences that overwhelm new players

- [ ] Prevent: Incomplete tutorial state causing confusion

- [ ] Prevent: Tutorial progression blocking main game access

- [ ] Prevent: Inconsistent mentor personality in tutorial vs main game
