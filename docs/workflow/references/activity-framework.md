# Activity Framework

The activity framework defines how educational content is structured into engaging, time-managed learning experiences. Activities serve as the bridge between individual educational challenges and meaningful skill development, creating a progression system that adapts to student growth while maintaining consistent engagement.

## Activity Design Philosophy

Activities in Rogue Resident are designed around **purposeful learning experiences** rather than arbitrary content delivery. Each activity has clear educational objectives, connects to the Knowledge Constellation, and provides meaningful progression toward professional competence.

The system emphasizes **contextual learning** - placing educational challenges within realistic professional scenarios that help students understand not just the "what" but the "why" and "when" of medical physics concepts.

## Dual Interface System for Professional Context

### Pokemon-Style Educational Transitions

The activity system now implements **Pokemon-style learning transitions** that transform educational content from "drive-by learning" into engaging medical simulations with clear mental preparation for learning:
