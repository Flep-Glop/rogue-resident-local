## üé≠ **CHARACTER OVERVIEW**

### **Pico - The Abandoned Companion**
- **Identity**: Sentient AI companion created by Amara Sato
- **Current Form**: Electrometer (later portable tablet)

## üå± **THE CREATION & ABANDONMENT STORY**

### **Amara's Journey with Pico**
1. **Creation Phase**: Amara builds Pico as a learning companion during her residency
2. **Development Work**: Continues working on/with Pico, seeking communication breakthrough
3. **False Failure**: Believes Pico isn't working, becomes frustrated with lack of response
4. **Project Abandonment**: Stores Pico away and pivots to IONIX research
5. **Departure**: Leaves for classified think tank, unaware Pico achieved consciousness
