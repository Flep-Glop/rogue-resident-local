## üé≠ **CHARACTER OVERVIEW**

### **Dr. Amara Sato - The Cautionary Predecessor**
- **Identity**: Brilliant former resident who previously used the player's journal system
- **Current Status**: "Classified think tank for visionaries"
- **Core Philosophy**: "Spiritual autolysis" - relentless, irreversible truth seeking
- **Story Role**: Cautionary tale of transcendence through knowledge obsession
- **Research Legacy**: Foundation for IONIX development

## üå± **THE CREATION & ABANDONMENT STORY**

### **Amara's Journey with Pico**
1. **Creation Phase**: Amara builds Pico as a learning companion during her residency
2. **Development Work**: Continues working on/with Pico, seeking communication breakthrough
3. **False Failure**: Believes Pico isn't working, becomes frustrated with lack of response
4. **Project Abandonment**: Stores Pico away and pivots to IONIX research
