## 🔗 INTEGRATION STRATEGY (Anti-Patchwork)

### **Data Flow Architecture**

player_actions -> relationship_progression: activity_participation, dialogue_choices

relationship_progression -> aptitude_system: bonus_calculations, special_access

mentor_system -> activity_framework: guidance_content, preparation_support

dialogue_system -> narrative_framework: character_development, story_progression


### **Shared Dependencies** (Plan for these)

- Activity completion tracking

- Player progress and performance data

- Narrative state and story progression

- UI systems for relationship display


### **💥 FAILURE MODES TO PREVENT**

- Inconsistent mentor personality across interactions

- Relationship progression that feels grindy rather than meaningful

- Unclear benefits from mentor relationships

- Mentor dialogue that breaks character voice


### **�� Testing Strategy**

- Mentor personality consistency testing

- Relationship progression balance testing

- Dialogue system integration testing
