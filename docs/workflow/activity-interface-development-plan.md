## üîó INTEGRATION STRATEGY (Anti-Patchwork)

### **Data Flow Architecture**

hospital_backdrop -> room_transition: room_id, activity_type, player_state

room_transition -> dialogue_systems: activity_content, mentor_context

dialogue_systems -> activity_framework: completion_data, choices_made

activity_framework -> game_state: rewards, relationship_changes, progress


### **Shared Dependencies** (Plan for these)

- Game state management (save/load)

- Audio system (music, sound effects)

- Input handling (mouse, keyboard)

- Performance monitoring (FPS, memory)


### **üí• FAILURE MODES TO PREVENT**

- Inconsistent state between components

- Asset loading blocking user interaction

- Memory leaks from frequent transitions

- Broken integration when one component changes


### **ÔøΩÔøΩ Testing Strategy**

- Component isolation testing

- Integration flow testing

- Performance testing with multiple transitions

- Error recovery testing
