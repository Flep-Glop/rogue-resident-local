**\#\# PART 1: GAME OVERVIEW & CORE MECHANICS**

**\#\#\# 1.1 Game Concept**

**\*\*Game Title:\*\* Rogue Resident**    
**\*\*Tagline:\*\* "The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a constellation to be illuminated."**

**\*\*High Concept:\*\***    
**Rogue Resident is an educational roguelike game that transforms medical physics education into a narrative-driven experience where expertise development is visualized as a growing constellation of interconnected knowledge. Players navigate procedurally-generated hospital "floors," encountering challenges that mirror authentic professional development, while alternating between day phase (active learning) and night phase (reflection and connection).**

**\*\*Target Audience:\*\***  
**\- Primary: Medical physics students and residents**  
**\- Secondary: Medical physics professionals seeking continued education**  
**\- Tertiary: Individuals interested in the field or similar technical domains**

**\*\*Educational Philosophy:\*\***    
**The game's core philosophical approach reframes learning from linear accumulation to interconnected synthesis. Rather than treating knowledge as isolated facts to be memorized, Rogue Resident models the development of expertise as a process of:**  
**1\. Exposure to concepts in authentic contexts**  
**2\. Practice applying knowledge in varied scenarios**  
**3\. Connection of related concepts to form patterns**  
**4\. Synthesis of concepts to solve novel problems**  
**5\. Mastery through intuitive understanding**
