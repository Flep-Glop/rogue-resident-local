ROGUE RESIDENT: CONSOLIDATED GAME DESIGN DOCUMENT
VERSION INFORMATION
Last Updated: April 25, 2025
Status: Post-Vertical Slice Refinement / Pre-Production
Document Version: 3.0
This document serves as the single source of truth for Rogue Resident's game design, consolidating and superseding all prior design documents (including GDD v2.1, Vertical Slice Guide, Strategy PDF, etc.) and incorporating recent design decisions.
PART 1: GAME OVERVIEW & CORE MECHANICS
1.1 Game Concept
Game Title: Rogue Resident
Tagline: "The mind is not a vessel to be filled, but a constellation to be illuminated."
High Concept:
Rogue Resident is an educational roguelike game that transforms medical physics education into a narrative-driven experience where expertise development is visualized as a growing constellation of interconnected knowledge. Players navigate hospital "floors" via a node-based map, encountering challenges that mirror authentic professional development, while alternating between a Day Phase (active learning and problem-solving) and a Night Phase (reflection, knowledge synthesis, and connection). The game features a two-arc narrative structure, following the player's journey through residency and into their early career as faculty.
Target Audience:
* Primary: Medical physics students and residents
* Secondary: Medical physics professionals seeking continued education
* Tertiary: Individuals interested in the field or similar technical domains
Educational Philosophy:
The game reframes learning from linear accumulation to interconnected synthesis. Knowledge isn't just facts to memorize, but concepts to be understood in context, practiced, connected, synthesized, and ultimately mastered intuitively. This is modeled through the core Day/Night loop and the Knowledge Constellation system.
Core Design Pillars (Post-Vertical Slice Refinements):
* Enhanced Node Map Experience: Focus on improving the existing node-map navigation through better context, signaling, feedback, and narrative integration, rather than shifting to a different core navigation model (e.g., walkable space).
* Progressive Disclosure: Introduce mechanics and complexity gradually to avoid overwhelming the player.
* Clearer Feedback Loops: Ensure players understand the impact of their choices on resources and game systems.
* Narrative Integration: Deeply weave the narrative context into the gameplay mechanics and progression.
1.2 Core Game Loop
The game revolves around a Day/Night cycle structure, enhanced based on strategic refinements:
Day Phase (Hospital Challenges - Active Learning)
Players navigate a node-based map representing a hospital floor, encountering various challenge nodes.
Activities:
1. Navigate: Move between connected nodes on the floor map (fixed layout per floor, potentially procedural variations later). Node paths and choices should be clearly signaled.
2. Select Challenge: Engage with nodes representing:
   * Clinical Nodes: Patient cases requiring treatment planning decisions.
   * QA Nodes: Equipment calibration and quality assurance challenges.
   * Educational Nodes: Concept explanations and knowledge synthesis.
   * Storage/Treasure: Discover tools and references (potential future feature).
   * Qualification Nodes: Tests of understanding required for progression.
   * Boss Encounters: Synthesis of multiple concepts to overcome major challenges (end of each floor).
   * Mentor Side Quests: Optional challenges with narrative depth (potential future feature).
3. Interact: Engage with mentor characters through dialogue. Initial onboarding and guidance provided by Dr. Garcia, introducing other mentors contextually.
4. Solve & Learn: Answer questions and solve problems related to medical physics concepts. Success leads to:
   * Gaining Momentum (short-term tactical resource).
   * Gaining Insight (Day-phase tactical resource).
   * Discovering Knowledge Concepts (added to the pool for Night Phase).
5. Use Abilities: Employ strategic abilities (Tangent, Boast) using accumulated resources (Insight, Momentum) to influence dialogue flow and outcomes.
6. Build Relationships: Interactions subtly influence relationships with mentors (tracked but with minimal gameplay impact initially).
7. Progress: Move towards the floor's boss encounter.
Key Enhancements:
* Onboarding: Utilize Dr. Garcia for initial welcoming, guidance, and setting expectations. A brief visual intro sequence establishes role, setting, and goal, visually introducing other mentors as Garcia describes the clinic.
* Clear Signaling: Enhance map nodes (domain color-coding, icons, concise labels), provide clearer feedback on choices and consequences. Reduce initial map choice complexity.
* Stronger Feedback: Use expressive mentor reactions, clear visual/audio cues for resource changes (Momentum/Insight), and characterful text feedback.
* Progressive Disclosure: Introduce Momentum first, then Insight/Tangent, then Boast contextually via mentor dialogue/interaction.
Night Phase (Knowledge Constellation - Reflection & Synthesis)
Players return to their hill home overlooking the hospital to reflect, synthesize knowledge, and prepare for the next day.
Activities:
1. Review Discoveries: See concepts discovered during the Day Phase presented as potential new stars.
2. Unlock Stars: Spend Star Points (SP) earned during the Day Phase to permanently unlock discovered concept stars in the constellation.
3. Activate Stars: Toggle unlocked stars to an "active" state for the next Day Phase (no SP cost). Specific stars must be active to progress through floors (see Part 4).
4. Observe Connections: View automatically formed connections between unlocked stars. Connection strength (mastery) increases through related Day Phase activities. Visuals indicate connection mastery.
5. Review Journal: Access the journal to review concept details, character notes, etc.
6. Monitor Mastery: Observe overall progress across knowledge domains.
7. (Future Design) Meaningful Impact: Interactions in the Night Phase (activating specific stars/connections) should influence the content, challenges, or opportunities presented in the subsequent Day Phase. This interaction is a Key Area for Immediate Design and Clarification.
Key Enhancements:
* Clearer Transition: Provide a brief Day summary screen showing concepts discovered and SP earned before transitioning to the Night Phase.
* Explicit Feedback: Give clear feedback when connections are formed and when their mastery increases.
* Journal Integration: Automatically log concepts, connections, and potentially add player-voice reflections.
1.3 Resource Systems
1. Momentum (Short-term Tactical - Day Phase)
   * Visualized: ⚡ Pips (0-3 levels).
   * Accumulation: Consecutive correct answers/successful actions within a challenge.
   * Benefit: Enables the Boast ability when at max level (Level 3). May provide minor Insight multipliers (TBD).
   * Decay/Reset: Resets upon incorrect answers or potentially at the end of a challenge node.
   * Feedback: Clear visual/audio cues for gain/loss/max level.
2. Insight (Mid-term Tactical - Day Phase Only)
   * Visualized: ◆ Meter (e.g., 0-100 points).
   * Accumulation: Gained through knowledge demonstration across challenges during the Day Phase.
   * Benefit: Powers special abilities used only during the Day Phase (Tangent, potentially deferred abilities).
   * Reset: Resets to zero at the start of each new Day Phase. It is an "in-run" currency for the current day.
   * Feedback: Clear visual/audio cues for gain/spending; UI indicates ability costs.
3. Star Points (SP) (Long-term Progression - Night Phase Only)
   * Visualized: ★ Counter.
   * Accumulation: Earned during the Day Phase (e.g., 1 SP per completed challenge node, bonus for floor boss completion). Earned even on failed runs ("falling forward").
   * Benefit: Sole use is to permanently unlock discovered concept stars in the Knowledge Constellation during the Night Phase.
   * Persistence: Persists between days and runs.
1.4 Special Abilities (Day Phase Only)
Abilities provide strategic options during dialogue challenges.
Implemented Abilities:
1. Tangent (Cost: 25 Insight)
   * Functionality: Swaps the content of the current question/problem to a related but different concept within the same domain, without changing difficulty.
   * Strategic Purpose: Allows the player to "dodge" a concept they are less comfortable with or explore alternative knowledge paths.
   * Trigger: Available during question phase if player has sufficient Insight.
2. Boast (Requires: Momentum Level 3)
   * Functionality: Replaces standard questions/dialogue options with high-difficulty alternatives related to the current topic.
   * Strategic Purpose: High-risk, high-reward path for potentially greater Insight gains or faster mastery progression upon success. Failure may have steeper penalties.
   * Trigger: Available alongside standard options when Momentum is maxed.
Deferred Implementation Abilities:
(These abilities are part of the design but are not prioritized for initial implementation to reduce complexity.)
3. Reframe (Cost: 50 Insight - Deferred)
   * Functionality: Changes the context or framing of the current problem, potentially providing a slightly more advantageous angle or hint without changing the core concept.
   * Strategic Purpose: Offers a way to approach a problem from a different perspective when stuck.
   * Trigger: Available during question phase if player has sufficient Insight.
4. Peer-Review (Cost: 75 Insight - Deferred)
   * Functionality: "Summons" a different mentor (based on availability/relationships) to provide a relevant hint or alternative perspective on the current problem.
   * Strategic Purpose: Provides substantial assistance by leveraging another expert's viewpoint.
   * Trigger: Available during question phase if player has sufficient Insight.
1.5 Knowledge Constellation System
The central metaphor and visualization of the player's developing expertise.
Components:
* Stars (Concepts): Represent individual knowledge concepts.

   * States:
      * Undiscovered: Not yet encountered.
      * Discovered: Encountered in Day Phase, appears as potential star in Night Phase.
      * Unlocked: SP spent in Night Phase, star is permanently added to constellation.
      * Active/Inactive: Player toggles state in Night Phase (influences next Day Phase & floor progression).
* Connections: Represent relationships between concepts.
   * Properties: ID, Source Star ID, Target Star ID, Strength/Mastery (0-100%), Discovered (Yes/No).
   * Formation: Automatically appear and become visible when both connected stars are unlocked.
   * Mastery: Connection mastery increases implicitly when related concepts are used together successfully in Day Phase challenges. Visualized by line thickness/brightness/style.
* Knowledge Domains (Color-Coded):
   * Treatment Planning (Blue: #3b82f6)
   * Radiation Therapy (Green: #10b981)

Key Area for Immediate Design:
* Night -> Day Influence: Define the specific mechanisms by which the Active status of stars and the mastery of connections in the Night Phase influence the content, difficulty, or opportunities within the subsequent Day Phase challenges.
1.6 Educational Content Structure
* Domains: Four core areas as listed above.
* Progression: Content generally flows from fundamental to advanced concepts across floors. Challenges adapt based on player's known concepts (influenced by active stars).
* Foundation: Leverages spaced repetition, conceptual mapping, narrative engagement, experiential learning, and mastery-based progression.
1.7 Roguelike Elements
* Run Structure: Day/Night cycles form micro-loops within a larger run across a hospital floor.
* Procedural Generation: Fixed layouts per floor initially. Future: Potential for procedural variation in node layout/types within a floor.
* Meta-progression: Knowledge (unlocked stars, mastery levels), relationships, and journal entries persist between runs and across the two narrative arcs. SP persists. Insight and Momentum reset daily/per run.
* Failure: Failing a run (e.g., failing a boss) resets progress to the start of the chosen floor, but persistent elements (knowledge, SP) are retained ("Falling Forward").
