## Momentum Progression Examples

### Successful Run (High Momentum Path)
```
Q1: Linac ID → +1 momentum (Total: 1) → +1 Beam Physics mastery
Q2: Energy penetration → +1 momentum (Total: 2) → +1 Beam Physics mastery
Q3B: Flat panel function → +1 momentum (Total: 3) → +1 Beam Physics mastery  
Q4B: Clinical context → +1 momentum (Total: 4) → +2 Beam Physics mastery (Medium tier!)
→ Screen begins subtle focus effect, continues building toward High momentum
```

### Struggling Run (Low Momentum Path)
```
Q1: Linac ID → +1 momentum (Total: 1) → +1 Beam Physics mastery
Q2: Energy penetration → Wrong → -1 momentum (Total: 0) → No mastery gain
Q3A: Safety basics → +1 momentum (Total: 1) → +1 Beam Physics mastery
Q4A: Lead blocking → Wrong → -1 momentum (Total: 0) → No mastery gain
→ Stays in confidence-building questions, normal screen view maintained
```

### Mixed Performance Example
```
Start strong → Reach Medium momentum (4-6) → Make mistake → Drop to Low
→ Screen effects fade back to normal → Rebuild confidence → Climb again
```
