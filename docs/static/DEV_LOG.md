# üìù DEVELOPMENT LOG
*Linear session tracking - wiped and integrated into core docs periodically*

---

## Entry #001
**Focus:** Documentation restructure and consolidation
**Smooth:** Successfully identified all critical patterns and insights from 10+ documents
**Friction:** Initial concern about losing hard-earned insights - resolved by thorough review
**Insight:** Lean documentation with clear navigation is more valuable than comprehensive but scattered docs

---

## Entry #002
**Focus:** [Session focus here]
**Smooth:** [What worked well, which patterns were successful]
**Friction:** [What slowed progress, what issues arose and how they were solved]
**Insight:** [Key learning that should be remembered for future sessions]

---

## Entry #003
**Focus:** [Session focus here]
**Smooth:** [What worked well]
**Friction:** [Issues + solutions]
**Insight:** [Key learning]

<!-- 
TEMPLATE FOR NEW ENTRIES:

## Entry #[NUMBER]
**Focus:** [Primary goal or feature being built/fixed]
**Smooth:** [What worked well, successful patterns used]
**Friction:** [Challenges encountered and their solutions]
**Insight:** [Key learning to carry forward]

GUIDELINES:
- Keep entries concise and actionable
- Focus on patterns and solutions, not detailed implementation
- Note architectural decisions that might affect future work
- Flag any discoveries that should migrate to core docs
- No dates, no time estimates, no complexity assessments
- Number entries sequentially regardless of gaps between sessions
-->

## ENTRIES TO MIGRATE TO CORE DOCS
*List insights that should be moved to permanent documentation*

- [ ] Example: New pattern discovered that works well
- [ ] Example: CSS quirk that affects multiple components
- [ ] Example: Performance optimization technique

## WHEN TO WIPE THIS LOG
- After ~20-30 entries
- When file becomes unwieldy
- During major version transitions
- After migrating key insights to core docs

## WHAT GETS PRESERVED
- Architectural decisions ‚Üí ARCHITECTURE.md
- Proven patterns ‚Üí PATTERNS.md
- Sprite specifications ‚Üí SPRITES.md
- Known bugs/issues ‚Üí STACK.md
- Workflow improvements ‚Üí HUB.md
