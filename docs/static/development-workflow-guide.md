3. **Test Changes**
   - Verify functionality in development server
   - Test on multiple devices/browsers
   - Check visual consistency

4. **Update Version & Changelog**
   - Choose appropriate version bump type
   - Write user-friendly changelog entry
   - Update version information

5. **Commit & Push**
   - Follow commit message guidelines
   - Include relevant issue references
   - Push to appropriate branch

## Version Management

### Version Bump Types

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Patch** | Bug fixes, minor tweaks | `0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.1.1` |
| **Minor** | New features, improvements | `0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.2.0` |
| **Major** | Breaking changes, overhauls | `0.1.0 ‚Üí 1.0.0` |

### Using the Version Management System

#### Quick Updates (Recommended)
```bash
# Bug fix
npm run version:patch "Fixed constellation star alignment issue"

# New feature
npm run version:minor "Added mentor relationship progression system"

# Major update
npm run version:major "Redesigned hospital navigation interface"
```

#### Manual Script Usage
```bash
node scripts/update-version.js patch "Description of changes"
```

#### Complex Updates
For updates with multiple changes, manually edit `app/utils/versionManager.ts`:

```typescript
{
  version: "v0.2.0-dev",
  date: "2024-12-19",
  type: "minor",
  highlights: [
    "New mentor relationship system",
    "Enhanced hospital navigation",
    "Improved performance optimizations"
  ],
  changes: [
    "Added comprehensive mentor relationship progression with visual indicators",
    "Implemented smooth hospital room transitions with isometric perspective",
    "Enhanced TPS visualization with real-time dose calculations",
    "Optimized constellation rendering for better performance on mobile devices",
    "Fixed various UI inconsistencies reported by playtesters",
    "Updated pixel art assets for better visual clarity"
  ]
}
```

git checkout -b feature/mentor-relationships

# Implement following architecture patterns
# Reference: docs/static/architecture-patterns.md
```

### 3. Testing Phase
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Test across different devices
# Verify theme consistency
# Check performance impact
```

### 4. Documentation Phase
- Update relevant component documentation
- Add inline code comments

- Prepare changelog entries

### 5. Version & Release Phase
```bash
# Update version with appropriate type
npm run version:minor "Added mentor relationship system"

# Commit with proper message format
git add .
git commit -m "feat(game): implement mentor relationship progression

# Push to main (or merge feature branch)
git push origin main
```

## Playtester Communication

### In-Game Notifications
The version management system automatically provides:

- **"What's New" Button**: Visible on title screen
- **"New" Badge**: Appears for updates within 7 days
- **Changelog Popup**: User-friendly display of recent changes
- **Version Display**: Current version shown on title screen

### Writing Effective Changelog Entries

#### Good Examples ‚úÖ
```
"Added interactive mentor dialogue system with branching conversations"
"Fixed constellation stars disappearing on mobile devices"
"Improved hospital room loading times by 40%"
"Enhanced pixel art clarity for better readability"
```

#### Poor Examples ‚ùå
```
"Updated mentor system" (too vague)
"Fixed bug in constellation.tsx line 45" (too technical)
"Refactored state management" (not user-facing)
"Various improvements" (not specific)
```

#### Best Practices
1. **Focus on user impact**: What will players notice?
2. **Use active voice**: "Added", "Fixed", "Improved"
3. **Be specific**: Mention exact features or problems
4. **Group related changes**: Combine similar fixes
5. **Highlight major features**: Use the `highlights` array

# Solution: Ensure you're in git repository with commits
git status
git log --oneline -1
```

#### Commit Message Issues
```bash
# Error: Commit message too long
# Solution: Use proper format with body for details

# Good:
git commit -m "feat(ui): add changelog popup

Detailed explanation in body..."

# Bad:
git commit -m "feat(ui): add changelog popup with themed styling and animations and responsive design and integration with version management system"
```

#### Build/Deploy Issues
```bash
# Error: Build fails after version update
# Solution: Clear Next.js cache and rebuild
rm -rf .next
npm run build

# Error: TypeScript errors after update
# Solution: Check imports and type definitions
npm run lint
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Hotfix Process
```bash
# Create hotfix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-fix

# Implement fix
# ... make changes ...

# Update version (patch)
npm run version:patch "Critical fix for game-breaking bug"

# Fast-track commit
git add .
git commit -m "hotfix: resolve critical gameplay bug
