   - Follow commit message guidelines
   - Include relevant issue references
   - Push to appropriate branch

## Git Remote Configuration

### Initial Setup & Verification

**CRITICAL**: Always verify your git remote is pointing to the correct repository before committing and pushing. This prevents accidentally pushing game code to documentation repositories or vice versa.

#### Verify Current Remote
```bash
# Check current remote configuration
git remote -v

# Expected output for game development:
# origin  https://github.com/Flep-Glop/rogue-resident-local (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/Flep-Glop/rogue-resident-local (push)
```

#### Common Remote Issues

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Wrong Repository** | Remote points to `-docs` instead of `-local` | Update remote URL |
| **Branch Divergence** | "Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged" | Fetch and check alignment |
| **Access Denied** | Authentication errors during push | Check GitHub permissions |

#### Fix Wrong Remote Repository
```bash
# If remote points to wrong repo (e.g., rogue-resident-docs)
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Flep-Glop/rogue-resident-local

# Verify the change
git remote -v

# Fetch to update remote tracking
git fetch origin

# Check status alignment
git status
```

#### Repository Structure

**Rogue Resident** uses separate repositories for different purposes:

- **`rogue-resident-local`**: Main game codebase with Next.js app
- **`rogue-resident-docs`**: Documentation-only repository
- **Other branches**: Feature branches, experimental versions

### Pre-Development Remote Check

Add this to your development startup routine:

```bash
# Development Session Startup Checklist
echo "üîç Verifying git remote configuration..."
git remote -v

echo "üìä Checking git status..."
git status

echo "üîÑ Fetching latest changes..."
git fetch origin

echo "‚úÖ Ready for development!"
npm run dev
```

### Remote Troubleshooting

#### Branch Divergence Resolution
```bash
# If branches have diverged unexpectedly
git status
# Check: "Your branch and 'origin/main' have diverged"

# Fetch latest remote information
git fetch origin

# Check what's different
git log --oneline --graph --all -10

# If remote is behind your work (safe to push)
git push origin main

# If remote has changes you don't have (need to pull)
git pull origin main

# If histories are completely different (check repository!)
git log origin/main --oneline -5
# Compare with your local commits
git log --oneline -5
```

#### Authentication Issues
```bash
# If push fails with authentication error
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

# For GitHub, ensure you're using the correct authentication method
# (personal access token, SSH key, etc.)
```

#### Emergency Remote Reset
```bash
# ONLY if you're certain the remote is wrong and you need to reset
# This will lose any work that hasn't been pushed to the correct remote

# Backup current work first
git branch backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Set correct remote
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Flep-Glop/rogue-resident-local

# Force push if needed (use with extreme caution)
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## Version Management

### Version Bump Types

| Type | When to Use | Example |
