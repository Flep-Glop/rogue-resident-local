---

## üí° **LESSONS LEARNED & KEY DECISIONS (Phase 1)**

This section documents key insights and architectural decisions made during the implementation of Phase 1.

### **7. Tutorial Flow Streamlining**
- **Problem**: Original Quinn tutorial flow required 5 interactions before reaching actual learning content: (1) Tutorial welcome overlay, (2) "Yes, let's start" dialogue, (3) "Ready!" dialogue, (4) Activity preparation overlay, (5) "Start Questions" button in activity intro.
- **Solution**: Streamlined to zero intermediate interactions by: (1) Using `startTutorialSilently()` in `TitleScreen.tsx` to skip welcome overlay, (2) Combining dialogue nodes into single "Ready to begin?" prompt, (3) Removing activity preparation overlay to launch immediately, (4) Modified `QuinnTutorialActivity.tsx` to start directly in 'questions' phase, skipping intro screen.
- **Impact**: Reduced friction from 5 clicks to 1 click to reach learning content. Player now goes: Title Screen ‚Üí Quinn's "Ready to begin?" ‚Üí First physics question. Dramatically improves first-time player experience and gets players engaged faster.
- **Architecture**: This demonstrates the value of the tutorial overlay system's flexibility and component phase management - both overlays and activity phases can be selectively enabled/disabled without breaking the core tutorial flow architecture.

### **8. Quinn Portrait Optimization: Reverting to Static Image**
- **Context**: Initially attempted to implement Quinn as an animated sprite sheet similar to Garcia and Jesse, but the user updated the image to be a single static frame for simplification.
- **Problem**: The sprite sheet animation logic was implemented but became unnecessary when the user updated `quinn-medium.png` from a multi-frame sprite sheet to a single static image (file size reduced from ~2.2KB to 697B).
- **Solution**: Reverted Quinn back to using simple static portrait display: (1) Removed Quinn from sprite sheet configuration in `spriteMap.ts`, (2) Simplified `MentorPortrait` component in `QuinnTutorialActivity.tsx` back to `styled.img`, (3) Updated all components to exclude Quinn from sprite sheet logic, (4) Fixed linter error with `addInsight` ‚Üí `updateInsight` method name.
- **Technical Approach**: Used clean architecture principles - the sprite sheet system was designed to be easily extensible/removable, so reverting Quinn required minimal changes without breaking other mentors' animations.
- **Impact**: Quinn now displays as a crisp, static portrait that loads efficiently while maintaining visual consistency. Garcia and Jesse retain their animated expressions, demonstrating the system's flexibility to handle both static and animated mentors seamlessly.
- **Architecture Lesson**: This demonstrates the value of modular design - the sprite sheet animation system can selectively include/exclude mentors without architectural changes, and the transition between static and animated portraits is seamless.

### **9. Insight and Momentum Bar Integration**
- **Feature Request**: User wanted to integrate the sophisticated insight and momentum bar system from `TestActivity.tsx` into `QuinnTutorialActivity.tsx` to provide visual feedback for learning progress.
- **Implementation**: Successfully adapted and integrated the complete bar system: (1) Added styled components for `InsightBarHorizontal`, `MomentumBarHorizontal`, `AbilityBarContainer`, and `SimpleTooltip`, (2) Added state management for `insightAnimating`, `insightAnimationFrame`, and `hoveredMeter`, (3) Implemented frame-to-frame animation logic with 80ms timing for classic pixel art feel, (4) Added insight animation triggering in `handleAnswerSelect` when correct answers are given.
- **Technical Details**: The insight bar uses a 30-frame sprite sheet (/images/ui/insight-bar-vertical.png) with animation frames 2-22 for filling effects and static frames 23-30 for fullness levels. The momentum bar uses a 10-frame sprite sheet (/images/ui/momentum-bar.png) that directly maps current momentum (0-10) to frame index.
- **Visual Integration**: Bars appear at bottom of screen during questions phase with 3x scaling for visibility, interactive hover effects with tooltips, and smooth animations that trigger on insight gain. The system maintains the same professional quality as TestActivity while fitting Quinn's tutorial flow.
- **Architecture Benefits**: Demonstrates the reusability of the bar system across different activity types - the same visual components work seamlessly in both Jesse's complex testing environment and Quinn's focused tutorial, showcasing the modular design principles of the codebase.

### **1. `PixelContainer` Rendering Issue & Fix**
- **Problem**: A fundamental CSS layering issue was discovered in the `ExpandableDialogContainer` (which uses `PixelContainer`). The `border-image` property with the `fill` keyword was rendering an opaque layer *on top of* the container's children, making all text and content invisible.
- **Debugging Process**: The issue was isolated through a systematic process of elimination:
  1. Verified dialogue data and state were correct via console logs.
  2. Ruled out React hook/state issues by confirming the component was rendering.
  3. Bypassed the `ExpandableDialogContainer` with a plain `div`, which correctly rendered text. This confirmed the container itself was the source of the problem.
- **Solution**: The `ExpandableContainer`'s architecture was refactored. The flexbox properties were moved to the inner `ContentWrapper`, making the `ExpandableContainer` a pure background/border layer. This ensures content is always rendered on top.
- **Future Implication**: This is the correct architectural pattern for using complex `border-image` styling. Any future components using this technique must separate the border/background container from the content container to ensure proper layering.

### **2. Dialogue System Pragmatism**
- **Decision**: To unblock progress, the `ExpandableDialogContainer` was temporarily replaced with a styled `div` in `NarrativeDialogue.tsx`.
- **Reasoning**: While the root cause in `PixelContainer` was being diagnosed, this pragmatic step allowed us to verify that the rest of the dialogue and tutorial systems were functioning correctly. It demonstrates a key workflow principle: **isolate and bypass problematic components to maintain velocity in other areas.**
- **Action Item**: A follow-up task should be created to apply the architectural fix to the `PixelContainer` and reinstate it in the `NarrativeDialogue` component, ensuring the original visual style is restored.

### **3. Content Adaptation: Jesse to Quinn**
- **Process**: Jesse's practical, equipment-focused "Beam Basics" questions were successfully adapted into Quinn's conceptual, theoretical "Physics Fundamentals" questions.
- **Key Insight**: The underlying momentum-based question system is highly flexible and can accommodate different teaching styles and content domains without architectural changes.
- **Content Created**: A full 12-question set for Quinn's micro-day activity was created, covering:
  - Photon interactions (Photoelectric/Compton)
  - Energy principles and penetration
  - Safety principles (Inverse Square Law)
  - Dose calculation and units (Gray)
  - Advanced concepts (Monte Carlo, Optimization Theory)

### **4. Dialogue Flow & Integration**
- **Implementation**: Quinn's introductory and follow-up dialogues were created and successfully integrated with the tutorial activity trigger system.
- **Technical Detail**: The `triggersActivity` flag in a dialogue option correctly launches the `QuinnTutorialActivity`, and the `nextNodeId` ensures the conversation seamlessly continues with the post-activity dialogue (`quinn_reflection`). This confirms the dialogue-to-activity-to-dialogue flow is working as designed.

### **5. Dialogue Component Structural Flaw & Fix**
- **Problem**: A critical layout flaw in `NarrativeDialogue.tsx` was preventing dialogue options from appearing on screen, despite being correctly loaded in the application's state. This became a major point of friction and consumed significant debugging time.
- **Debugging Process**: The issue was isolated by:
  1. Confirming option data was present in the component via console logs.
  2. Temporarily replacing the styled `OptionButton` with a basic `div`. When the `div` also failed to render, it confirmed the problem was structural, not CSS-related.
  3. A review of the component's JSX revealed the `<OptionsContainer>` was rendered outside its parent, `<DialogueSection>`.
- **Solution**: The fix was to move the `<OptionsContainer>` to be a child of the `<DialogueSection>`, which corrected the layout and made the options instantly visible.
- **Key Lesson**: This incident underscored the critical importance of correct JSX/HTML structure. A seemingly minor misplacement of a component in the tree can lead to major, hard-to-diagnose rendering failures. It serves as a reminder to always verify component hierarchy when facing layout bugs.

### **6. Rapid UI Polish and Content Streamlining**
- **Content Strategy**: Following the "get to the gameplay faster" principle, Quinn's introductory dialogue in `tutorialDialogues.ts` was significantly streamlined. All verbose explanations and stage directions were removed to create a more direct and faster-paced player experience.
- **UI Polish Cycle**: Once the structural bug was resolved, the component architecture proved highly effective for rapid visual iteration based on direct feedback. In a single session, the following was accomplished:
  - **Dialogue Box:** Reduced font size and line height for dialogue text and the speaker name. The option button was also shrunk considerably.
  - **Tutorial Overlays:** Dramatically increased the font size for titles and content in `TutorialOverlay.tsx` to enhance readability.
- **Insight**: This validates that the styling architecture is robust and allows for efficient, targeted visual adjustments, which is crucial for iterative development and polishing.

### **10. Unified Visual Interface & Content Cleanup**
- **User Request**: Remove redundant text displays for insight/momentum, integrate visual bars into the bottom ability bar, reduce question text line spacing, and eliminate stage directions from Quinn's dialogue.
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive UI cleanup and integration: (1) Removed text-based "Insight: 30" display from ability bar, (2) Moved visual insight and momentum bars from separate floating container into the unified bottom ability bar, (3) Expanded `AbilitiesBarContainer` to `min-width: 600px` to accommodate bars, (4) Added visual separator between bars and ability slots, (5) Removed "Question 2 of 8 | Momentum: 1/10 | Insight: 38" progress display entirely, (6) Reduced question text `line-height` from 1.6 to 1.3 for tighter spacing, (7) Cleaned stage directions like `*gestures to fundamental equations on screen*` from Quinn's questions.
- **Technical Details**: The integration preserves all visual bar functionality (animations, hover effects, tooltips) while creating a unified interface. Tooltip positioning was adjusted for the new layout. The `ProgressInfo` component was removed entirely as redundant with the visual bars.
- **Visual Result**: Bottom interface now displays: **[Insight Bar] [Momentum Bar] [Separator] [Ability Slot 1] [Ability Slot 2] [Ability Slot 3] [Ability Slot 4]** - a clean, integrated design that focuses on visual feedback over redundant text.
- **Architecture Validation**: This demonstrates the modular design's success - the bar system components were easily relocated and integrated without breaking existing functionality. The tooltip system automatically adapted to new positioning, showing the flexibility of the fixed positioning architecture.
- **User Experience**: Significantly cleaner interface with no information loss - players get all the same feedback through elegant visual bars while enjoying more compact question text and natural dialogue flow without distracting stage directions.

### **11. Layout Reorganization & Hybrid Coordinate System**
- **User Request**: Reorganize the Quinn tutorial interface to free up center space for questions by moving the mentor portrait to the top left with independent positioning and converting the horizontal ability bar to a vertical layout on the right side.
- **Implementation Process**: Systematic layout transformation: (1) Moved Quinn's portrait from centered ContentArea to fixed top-left positioning (`top: 8vh, left: 4vw`), (2) Converted ability bar from horizontal bottom layout to vertical right-side layout using `flex-direction: row` with two main sections, (3) Removed all CSS rotation transforms that were causing complexity, (4) Created side-by-side arrangement: momentum/insight bars in left section, ability slots stacked in right section, (5) Fixed tooltip overflow issues by adding `overflow: visible` to all containers, (6) Aligned bar bottoms using `justify-content: flex-end` and consistent container heights.
- **Hybrid Coordinate System**: Developed a lightweight positioning system as an alternative to both hard-coded CSS and complex world coordinates:
  ```typescript
  const UICoordinates = {
    mentor: { 
      top: '8vh', left: '4vw', size: '165px',
      offsetX: '200px', offsetY: '230px' 
    },
    abilityBar: { 
      right: '2vw', gap: '2.5vw', 
      offsetX: '30px', offsetY: '0px' 
    },
    insightBar: { 
      offsetX: '14px', offsetY: '-10px' 
    }
  }
  ```
- **Pros of Hybrid Approach**: (1) **Easy Adjustments** - Change `offsetX: '14px'` instead of hunting through CSS, (2) **Responsive by Default** - Uses viewport units (`vw`, `vh`) for automatic scaling, (3) **Single Source of Truth** - All positioning logic centralized, (4) **Element Independence** - Individual offset controls for fine-tuning without affecting other elements, (5) **Scalable** - Easy to add new UI elements using same system, (6) **Maintainable** - No scattered hard-coded values.
- **Cons of Hybrid Approach**: (1) **Added Complexity** - More setup than simple CSS positioning, (2) **Learning Curve** - Team members need to understand the coordinate system, (3) **Potential Over-engineering** - May be overkill for very simple layouts, (4) **CSS Transform Chaining** - Requires careful management of multiple transforms (e.g., `translateY(-50%) translate(offsetX, offsetY)`).
- **Technical Details**: Uses CSS `transform: translate()` for offset positioning while preserving base responsive positioning with viewport units. Individual styled components (e.g., `InsightBarContainer`) apply specific offsets while maintaining hover effects and interactions. Container overflow set to `visible` ensures tooltips extend beyond boundaries.
- **Architecture Decision**: Chose hybrid approach over full world coordinate system (used in `HospitalBackdrop.tsx`) as a middle ground - more flexible than fixed CSS but less complex than complete coordinate transformation. Provides optimal balance for UI positioning needs.
- **User Experience Result**: (1) **Freed Center Space** - Questions now have maximum width and focus, (2) **Independent Positioning** - Mentor portrait and ability elements don't interfere with content layout, (3) **Visual Hierarchy** - Clear separation between educational content (center) and interface elements (edges), (4) **Precise Control** - Easy fine-tuning of element positions for optimal visual balance, (5) **Tooltip Functionality** - All hover effects and tooltips work correctly without cropping.
- **Long-term Value**: Establishes positioning pattern for future UI elements and demonstrates successful alternative to both hardcoded CSS and complex world coordinate systems. The approach scales well for additional interface components while maintaining performance and simplicity.

### **12. Typography System Migration & Theme-Based Consistency**
- **Context**: With assets now scaled to true 640x360 resolution, needed to migrate components from hardcoded typography values to the centralized theme system for consistency and maintainability.
- **Implementation**: Successfully migrated `QuinnTutorialActivity.tsx` from hardcoded values to theme-based styling: (1) Added proper theme imports (`colors`, `spacing`, `typography`, `animation`), (2) Converted `QuestionText` to use `typography.fontSize.sm` and `typography.lineHeight.tight`, (3) Updated `OptionButton` to use `typography.fontSize.sm` and theme spacing values, (4) Migrated `FeedbackText`, `AbilityIcon`, `AbilityTooltip`, `ResourceDisplay`, `SummaryContainer`, and `ResourceValue` to theme system, (5) Fixed TypewriterText line-height override issue by passing `style={{ lineHeight: typography.lineHeight.tight }}` to component.
- **Key Challenge**: TypewriterText component had hardcoded `lineHeight: '1.6'` in its default styles that was overriding styled component CSS due to higher specificity of inline styles. Solution was to pass style prop to override the component's defaults.
- **Technical Benefits**: (1) **Consistency** - All text now follows the design system, (2) **Maintainability** - Global typography changes update everywhere, (3) **Scalability** - Easy to adjust text sizing for different screen sizes, (4) **Clean Code** - No more scattered hardcoded pixel values.
- **Migration Pattern Established**: This demonstrates the successful pattern for migrating existing components to theme-based styling: (1) Import theme modules, (2) Replace hardcoded values systematically, (3) Handle component-specific overrides with style props, (4) Test thoroughly to ensure visual consistency.

### **13. QuinnTutorialActivity Internal Resolution System Transformation & Evolution**
- **Initial Transformation**: Successfully transformed `QuinnTutorialActivity.tsx` from hybrid responsive positioning to the same 640x360 internal resolution system used by `NarrativeDialogue.tsx` for perfect architectural consistency.
- **Evolution to True Pixel Perfect**: Based on user feedback, evolved the system further by removing all scaling logic and implementing true pixel-perfect rendering at native sizes for crisper visuals and simpler architecture.
- **Sprite System Updates**: Updated sprite logic for new larger sprite assets: (1) **insight-bar-vertical.png**: 960x157 dimensions with 32px frame width (was 16px), (2) **momentum-bar.png**: 352x108 dimensions with 32px frame width (was 16px), (3) Updated `object-position` calculations from `frameIndex * -16px` to `frameIndex * -32px` for proper frame positioning.
- **UI Scaling & Enhancement**: Dramatically expanded UI elements: (1) **Ability slots**: 32px ‚Üí 96px (3x bigger), (2) **Ability icons**: 12px ‚Üí 36px font size (3x bigger), (3) **Container expansion**: 120px ‚Üí 240px height, increased padding and gaps for larger elements, (4) **Portrait optimization**: Maintained compact 80x80px size for balance.
- **Modular Offset Positioning Architecture**: Implemented sophisticated offset system for individual element positioning: (1) **Base positioning**: `abilityBar.right: 220px` for overall panel placement, (2) **Individual offsets**: `insightBar: { offsetX: 0, offsetY: -120 }` and `momentumBar: { offsetX: 0, offsetY: -30 }` for fine-tuned positioning, (3) **Hover preservation**: Maintain offsets in hover transform chains, (4) **Centralized control**: All positioning logic in single `UICoordinates` object.
- **Layout Reorganization**: Converted side-by-side bar layout to vertical stack with insight bar above momentum bar, creating cleaner alignment with ability slots and better use of screen space.
- **Architectural Benefits**: (1) **Perfect Consistency** - Both major UI systems (dialogue and tutorial) now use identical architectural patterns, (2) **True Pixel Perfect** - No scaling artifacts, crisp rendering at all viewport sizes, (3) **Individual Control** - Each UI element can be positioned independently without affecting others, (4) **Performance Optimized** - Removed complex scaling calculations for faster rendering, (5) **Maintainability** - Centralized positioning logic makes adjustments simple and predictable.
- **Technical Pattern Validation**: This transformation demonstrates the successful evolution from complex responsive systems to simple, powerful pixel-perfect architectures. The offset system provides the flexibility of complex positioning while maintaining the simplicity and performance of fixed pixel coordinates.

### **14. Resolution Consistency & Authentic Pixel Art Rendering**
- **Problem**: Quinn detailed portraits were still rendering at 2x scaled dimensions (233√ó322px) despite user scaling down asset exports to true size, causing inconsistent pixel densities and oversized appearance.
- **Root Cause Investigation**: Discovered that `PORTRAIT_DIMENSIONS` in `portraitUtils.ts` was still using the old 2x export dimensions, so even though container sizing was corrected, the `PortraitImage` component was rendering at much larger size than intended.
- **Solution**: Updated `PORTRAIT_DIMENSIONS.detailed` from `{ width: 233, height: 322 }` to `{ width: 116, height: 161 }` - exactly half the previous size to match the user's scaled-down asset exports.
- **Comprehensive Resolution Alignment**: (1) **NarrativeDialogue** already used proper 640√ó360 internal coordinate system, (2) **CharacterPortrait** sizing reduced from 233√ó322px to 116√ó161px, (3) **CharacterSection** container optimized from 350√ó200px to 180√ó180px, (4) **Background images** already properly sized to native 640√ó360, (5) **Font sizes** already appropriate for resolution (18-20px range).
- **Technical Impact**: Achieved true pixel density consistency across all game elements - no more mixing of 1x and 2x scaled assets that created visual artifacts. All sprites, portraits, and UI elements now render at their authentic pixel art size.
- **Architecture Validation**: This demonstrates the importance of centralizing dimension constants in utility files rather than hardcoding throughout components. The fix required changing only one constant to update all portrait rendering across the entire application.

### **15. Iterative Dialogue Layout Refinement & Systematic Debugging**
- **User-Driven Polish Process**: Conducted multiple rounds of targeted layout improvements for the narrative dialogue screen based on direct visual feedback, demonstrating effective iteration workflow.
- **Portrait Positioning**: Used simple CSS `bottom` value adjustment (40px ‚Üí 90px) rather than complex offset system, proving that straightforward solutions are often preferable for single-element adjustments.
- **Dialogue Layout Optimization**: Series of targeted improvements: (1) **"Dr. Quinn" Title Spacing** - Discovered dialogue box `padding: '24px'` was creating unwanted space above speaker name, reduced to `padding: '12px 24px'` (50% less vertical padding), (2) **Speaker Name Component** - Reduced `margin-bottom: 6px ‚Üí 2px` and added `margin-top: 0` for tighter spacing, (3) **Ready Button Sizing** - Made much smaller with `padding: xs/sm` and `font-size: 16px` for less visual weight, (4) **Question-Button Spacing** - Added `margin-top: spacing.lg` to `OptionsContainer` for proper separation, (5) **Dialogue Container Extension** - Reduced `bottom: 200px ‚Üí 120px` in DialogueSection and increased dialogue box `minHeight: 120px ‚Üí 160px` for better use of screen space.
- **Debugging Methodology**: Demonstrated systematic approach to UI issues: (1) User reported persistent spacing around "Dr. Quinn" despite component changes, (2) Investigated beyond component-level styling to find container-level padding creating the issue, (3) Identified root cause in dialogue box inline styles rather than styled components, (4) Applied targeted fixes to address each specific spacing concern.
- **Key Insight**: Complex spacing issues often have multiple contributing factors - dialogue box padding, component margins, container positioning, and element-specific styling all interact. Systematic investigation from outer containers inward is essential for finding root causes.
- **Polish Workflow Validation**: This session validates the component architecture's effectiveness for rapid visual iteration. Multiple layout adjustments were made quickly and precisely without breaking existing functionality, demonstrating the robustness of the styling system.
- **User Experience Result**: Achieved much tighter, more professional dialogue layout: "Dr. Quinn" title sits close to content, ready button is compact and unobtrusive, proper spacing between question text and interaction elements, and dialogue extends further down screen for better space utilization.

### **17. Hospital Backdrop Character System Simplification & Dual Positioning Architecture Discovery**
- **Context**: User requested streamlining the hospital backdrop by removing all walking character sprites except Quinn, positioning Quinn where Garcia was previously located, and ensuring the interactive click areas aligned properly.
- **Character Sprite Cleanup**: Systematic removal of walking mentors from `AMBIENT_CREATURES` array in `HospitalBackdrop.tsx`: (1) **Removed Garcia, Jesse, and Kapoor** walking sprites entirely from the ambient animation system, (2) **Repositioned Quinn** from `startX: 750, startY: 100` to Garcia's old position `startX: -350, startY: -150`, (3) **Preserved birds and deer** for ambient life while focusing interaction on single mentor, (4) **Maintained animation properties** - frameCount, scale, animationSpeed unchanged for Quinn.
- **Dual Positioning System Discovery**: Critical architectural insight revealed during click area adjustment: (1) **ROOM_AREAS system** - Controls room click boundaries and basic mentor assignments in `HospitalBackdrop.tsx`, (2) **MENTOR_TIME_SCHEDULE system** - Controls actual mentor tooltip positions and availability in `TutorialTimeProgression.ts`, (3) **Independent coordinate systems** - Room areas use percentage-based hospital coordinates while mentor positions use world coordinates, (4) **Debugging process** - Initial attempts to move click areas through ROOM_AREAS failed, revealing the separation between visual sprites and interactive mentor positioning.
- **Mentor System Integration**: Comprehensive updates across both positioning systems: (1) **Room assignments** - Changed physics-office from `mentorId: 'garcia'` to `mentorId: 'quinn'` in ROOM_AREAS, (2) **Mentor mapping** - Updated `ROOM_TO_MENTOR` to remove Garcia and keep only Quinn in physics-office, (3) **Schedule removal** - Completely removed Garcia from MENTOR_SCHEDULES in `mentorPositions.ts`, (4) **Time-based positioning** - Updated all time periods (dawn, day, evening, night) in MENTOR_TIME_SCHEDULE to position Quinn at Garcia's coordinates.
- **Precise Position Tuning**: Iterative refinement of Quinn's interactive position: (1) **Initial placement** - Started with Garcia's original `worldX: -400, worldY: -200`, (2) **User-directed adjustments** - Multiple rounds of fine-tuning based on visual alignment with walking sprite, (3) **Final coordinates** - Settled on `worldX: -350, worldY: -145` for optimal click area positioning, (4) **Tooltip enhancement** - Increased tooltip size significantly (`font-size: 14px ‚Üí 24px`, `padding: 10px 14px ‚Üí 20px 28px`) and repositioned lower (`bottom: -45px ‚Üí -90px`) for better visibility.
- **Architectural Lessons**: (1) **System Separation** - Walking sprites and interactive click areas are controlled by completely independent systems, requiring updates to both for complete functionality, (2) **Coordinate System Complexity** - Multiple coordinate systems (hospital percentages, world coordinates, screen coordinates) require careful attention when making positioning changes, (3) **Time-Awareness** - Mentor positioning system is time-of-day aware, requiring updates across all time periods for consistency, (4) **Debug Strategy** - When positioning changes don't work, investigate which system actually controls the behavior rather than assuming the obvious one.
- **User Experience Result**: (1) **Streamlined backdrop** - Single walking mentor (Quinn) creates cleaner, more focused hospital environment, (2) **Proper alignment** - Click area and tooltip accurately positioned over Quinn's walking sprite, (3) **Enhanced visibility** - Much larger, properly positioned tooltip improves discoverability and readability, (4) **Consistent interaction** - All time periods properly configured for Quinn-based tutorial flow.
- **Development Pattern**: Establishes methodology for character system modifications: (1) **Visual sprite changes** in AMBIENT_CREATURES, (2) **Room assignment updates** in ROOM_AREAS, (3) **Mentor mapping adjustments** in ROOM_TO_MENTOR, (4) **Time schedule modifications** in MENTOR_TIME_SCHEDULE, (5) **Iterative position tuning** based on visual feedback. This pattern ensures complete functionality when making character positioning changes.
