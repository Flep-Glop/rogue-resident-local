   - ‚úÖ 2-3 activity options per time block
   - ‚úÖ At least one activity from each domain
   - ‚úÖ Night Phase with constellation interaction

2. **Core Mechanics**
   - ‚úÖ Time-based navigation (hourly choices)
   - ‚úÖ Basic resource systems (Momentum, Insight, SP)
   - ‚úÖ Concept discovery and unlocking
   - ‚úÖ Star activation/deactivation

3. **Basic Mentor Interactions**
   - ‚úÖ Two mentors with basic dialogue
