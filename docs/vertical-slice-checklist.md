## Minimal Vertical Slice Scope

For a minimal playable vertical slice, implement at least:

1. **One Day-Night Cycle**
   - âœ… Morning (8 AM) to Evening (5 PM) time-based activities
   - âœ… 2-3 activity options per time block
   - âœ… At least one activity from each domain
   - âœ… Night Phase with constellation interaction

2. **Core Mechanics**
   - âœ… Time-based navigation (hourly choices)
   - âœ… Basic resource systems (Momentum, Insight, SP)
   - âœ… Concept discovery and unlocking
   - âœ… Star activation/deactivation

3. **Basic Mentor Interactions**
   - âœ… Two mentors with basic dialogue
   - âœ… Simple relationship tracking

4. **Minimal Progression**
   - âœ… 5-8 concepts that can be discovered
   - âœ… At least 3 connections between concepts
   - âœ… One special ability (Tangent or Boast)
