**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Design Specification  
**Last Updated:** May 16, 2025

## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document provides comprehensive specifications for the visual storytelling elements and narrative framework of Rogue Resident, focusing on creating a cohesive world that elevates the educational experience through compelling visual design and narrative integration.

## 1. VISUAL STORYTELLING ELEMENTS

### 1.1 Knowledge Constellation System

#### Visual Concept
- **Star Visualization:** Stars begin as faint outlines or nebulous forms that gradually solidify and brighten as mastery increases
- **Domain Environments:** Each domain region has distinctive visual elements:
  - **Treatment Planning (Blue):** Mathematical equations and beam path visualizations floating in background
  - **Radiation Therapy (Green):** Cell-like structures and biological elements
  - **Linac Anatomy (Amber):** Technical schematics and mechanical components
  - **Dosimetry (Pink):** Measurement devices and calibration markers

#### Connection & Pattern Visualization
- **Active Connections:** Particle flows along connection lines that reflect knowledge transfer
- **Pattern Formation:** When patterns form, create a "revelation" animation where the pattern briefly glows and emits particles
- **Mastery Representation:** Stars evolve visually as mastery increases - from dim outlines to brilliant, detailed celestial bodies
- **Discovery Visualization:** New stars appear with a subtle reveal animation, emerging from the cosmic background

### 1.2 Journal System

#### Physical Design
- **Cover:** Weathered leather with an embossed medical caduceus symbol that has subtle constellation points incorporated into the design
- **Binding:** Visible stitching with multi-colored thread representing the four domains
- **Wear Patterns:** Strategic weathering that increases at frequently referenced pages
- **Personalization:** Ability for player name to appear on cover (added during introduction)

#### Internal Organization
- **Section Tabs:** Color-coded tabs for different domains and functions
- **Card Pockets:** Three ornate card pockets on inside front cover for equipped Application cards
- **Progressive Content:** Pages that fill gradually as player progresses
- **Hidden Elements:** Fold-out sections, transparent overlays, and "invisible ink" that reveals with progress

### 1.3 Etching Visualization

#### Design Concept
- **Visual Style:** Historical medical diagrams merged with astronomical charts
- **Previous Owner Elements:** Handwritten notes, observations, and calculations in margins
- **Progressive Revelation:** Etchings begin partially obscured and become clearer as prerequisites are met
- **Source-Based Design:**
  - **Library Etchings:** Academic, precise, on aged parchment

## CONCLUSION

This document outlines a comprehensive visual and narrative framework for Rogue Resident that creates a cohesive world while enhancing the educational experience. By integrating the mystery of Amara Sato with the Knowledge Constellation system, we transform educational content into a compelling journey of discovery that motivates player progression.

The journal serves as both a gameplay tool and narrative device, documenting the player's growth while gradually revealing the mysteries of the Knowledge Constellation approach and Amara's discovery. The visual design emphasizes domain distinctions while maintaining a unified aesthetic that reinforces the game's medical physics foundation.

Implementation should focus on core gameplay elements first, with narrative and visual enhancements layered in as development resources permit. The Amara/Ionix storyline provides a flexible framework that can be expanded or contracted based on production constraints while still delivering a satisfying player experience.
