## System Overview

The Knowledge Constellation system is the central visualization mechanic for player progress in Rogue Resident. It represents medical physics concepts as stars in a night sky, with connections between related concepts and patterns forming constellations that unlock special insights.

**Core Principles:**
- Stars represent individual concepts, brightening as mastery increases
- Connections show relationships between concepts
- Patterns (constellations) form when specific sets of stars are connected
- Cross-domain connections represent interdisciplinary understanding
- Layout follows a hybrid orbital-quadrant model

## Star Data Structure

Each star in the constellation is defined by the following properties:

```typescript
interface ConceptStar {
  id: string;                          // Unique identifier
  name: string;                        // Display name
  description: string;                 // Short description of concept
  domain: KnowledgeDomain;             // Domain this concept belongs to
  orbit: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3;                // Specialization level (0=core, 3=specialized)
  spCost: number;                      // Star Points required to unlock
  position: {                          // Default position in constellation
    x: number;                         // X coordinate (0-1000)
    y: number;                         // Y coordinate (0-1000)
  };
  mastery: number;                     // Current mastery level (0-100)
  discovered: boolean;                 // Whether player has discovered this concept
  active: boolean;                     // Whether concept is currently "active" in mind
  maxConnections: number;              // Maximum number of connections allowed
  connections: string[];               // IDs of connected stars
  prerequisites: string[];             // Stars that must be unlocked first
  crossDomainPotential: 'Low' | 'Medium' | 'High'; // Likelihood of cross-domain connections
  lastPracticed?: number;              // Timestamp of last practice (for decay)
  journalEntryIds: string[];           // Associated journal entries
}
```

## Connection Data Structure

```typescript
interface ConceptConnection {
  id: string;                          // Unique identifier
  source: string;                      // Source star ID
  target: string;                      // Target star ID
  type: ConnectionType;                // Type of connection
  strength: number;                    // Connection strength (0-100)
  discovered: boolean;                 // Whether player has discovered this connection
  description?: string;                // Optional description of relationship
  patternIds: string[];                // Patterns this connection is part of
}

type ConnectionType = 
  | 'fundamental'                      // Basic relationship between concepts
  | 'application'                      // Applied relationship
  | 'theoretical'                      // Theoretical relationship
  | 'cross-domain';                    // Connects concepts from different domains
```

## Pattern Data Structure

Patterns (constellations) are defined by the following properties:

```typescript
interface ConstellationPattern {
  id: string;                          // Unique identifier
  name: string;                        // Display name

  reward: PatternReward;               // Reward for completing pattern
  hint?: string;                       // Optional hint for discovering pattern
}

type PatternFormation = 'circuit' | 'triangle' | 'chain' | 'star' | 'grid';

interface PatternReward {
  type: 'sp' | 'ability' | 'insight' | 'challenge_bonus';
  value: number | string;              // Amount of SP or name of ability/insight
  description: string;                 // Description of the reward
}
```

## Domain Definitions

The constellation is organized into four primary domains:

```typescript
type KnowledgeDomain = 
  | 'treatment-planning'               // Treatment planning concepts
  | 'radiation-therapy'                // Radiation therapy delivery concepts
  | 'linac-anatomy'                    // Linear accelerator components and function
  | 'dosimetry';                       // Measurement and calibration concepts
```

**Domain Colors:**
- Treatment Planning: `#3b82f6` (Blue)
- Radiation Therapy: `#10b981` (Green)
- Linac Anatomy: `#f59e0b` (Amber)
- Dosimetry: `#ec4899` (Pink)

## Layout System

The constellation uses a hybrid orbital-quadrant layout:

1. **Quadrants:** Each domain occupies a quadrant of the constellation space
2. **Orbits:** Stars are arranged in concentric orbits representing specialization level
   - Orbit 0: Core concepts (center)
   - Orbit 1: Intermediate concepts
   - Orbit 2: Advanced concepts
   - Orbit 3: Specialized concepts
3. **Clustering:** Related stars within the same orbit and domain cluster together

**Coordinate System:**
- Origin (0,0) at center of constellation
- X and Y range from -500 to 500
- Domain quadrant angles:
  - Treatment Planning: 45째 (Northeast)
  - Radiation Therapy: 135째 (Southeast)
  - Linac Anatomy: 225째 (Southwest)
  - Dosimetry: 315째 (Northwest)
- Orbit radii:
  - Orbit 0: 0-50 units
  - Orbit 1: 100-150 units
  - Orbit 2: 200-250 units
  - Orbit 3: 300-350 units

## Mastery Visualization System

The mastery level of concepts is visually represented through several mechanisms:

1. **Star Brightness:**
   - 0-25% Mastery: Dim, small star
   - 25-50% Mastery: Brighter, medium star
   - 50-75% Mastery: Bright star with corona
   - 75-100% Mastery: Pulsing brilliant star

2. **Connection Strength:**
   - Fundamental connections start stronger (50% opacity)
   - Application and theoretical connections start weaker (30% opacity)
   - Connection opacity increases with usage (up to 100%)
   - Connection thickness increases with mastery of connected stars

3. **Domain Mastery Visualization:**
   - Each domain's overall mastery is shown as a color gradient
   - Domain sections become more vibrant as mastery increases
   - Special effects (cosmic dust, subtle movement) increase with domain mastery

4. **Visual Effects by Mastery Level:**

| Mastery Level | Star Size | Star Brightness | Corona Effect | Pulse Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0-25% | 75% | 40% opacity | None | None |
| 25-50% | 85% | 60% opacity | Faint | None |
| 50-75% | 100% | 80% opacity | Clear | None |
| 75-100% | 110% | 100% opacity | Bright | Slow pulse |
| 100% | 120% | 100% opacity | Vibrant | Distinct pulse |

## SP Economy

Star Points (SP) are the currency used to unlock new stars in the constellation.

**SP Sources:**
- Daily challenges: 5-15 SP per challenge
- Pattern completion: 15-35 SP per pattern
- Mentor relationship milestones: 10-25 SP per level
- Boss encounters: 30-50 SP per encounter

**SP Costs by Orbit:**
- Orbit 0 (Core): 10 SP
- Orbit 1 (Intermediate): 15 SP
- Orbit 2 (Advanced): 25 SP
- Orbit 3 (Specialized): 40-45 SP

**Balancing Considerations:**
- Initial player SP at start: 25 SP (enough for core + first intermediate)
- Average SP gain per day cycle: ~30-40 SP
- Average SP cost to unlock a significant branch: ~75-100 SP
- First completion of a pattern should provide ~50% of SP needed for a new star in that domain

## Implementation Notes

### Connection Formation Rules

1. Stars must have minimum 25% mastery to form connections
2. Stars can only form connections within their `maxConnections` limit
3. Cross-domain connections require at least 40% mastery in both stars
4. Connection strength starts at:
   - Fundamental connections: 50%
   - Application connections: 40%
   - Theoretical connections: 30%
   - Cross-domain connections: 25%
5. Connection strength increases by:
   - +5% each time related concepts are used together
   - +10% when a pattern involving the connection is completed
   - +1% per day when both stars are active

### Star Activation Rules

1. Players can manually activate/deactivate stars
2. Maximum active stars = 5 + (1 per 10 stars discovered)
3. Active stars:
   - Have higher visual prominence
   - Decay mastery more slowly
   - Are more likely to appear in challenges
   - Can form connections more easily

### Knowledge Decay System

1. Star mastery decays over time when not practiced
2. Decay rates:
   - Active stars: -0.5% per day
   - Inactive stars: -1% per day
   - 75%+ mastery stars: half the normal decay rate
   - Core concepts (Orbit 0): one-quarter the normal decay rate
3. Decay stops at 25% mastery (information is never completely forgotten)
4. Visual indicator shows time until decay will occur

### Shooting Star Events

1. Shooting stars represent special insight opportunities
2. Triggered by:
   - Completing a pattern (50% chance)
   - Reaching 75% domain mastery (100% chance)
   - Forming specific cross-domain connections (25% chance)
3. Shooting stars are temporary (disappear after ~2 days)
