## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **mentorVoice.ts**
   - Defines MentorId, MentorVoiceContext, and MentorVoicePatterns
   - Contains mentor profiles with domain-specific phrases and patterns

2. **mentorVoiceService.ts**
   - Provides methods to apply mentor voice patterns to templates
   - Handles placeholders and substitutions
   - Returns mentor-specific question variants

3. **Question Types**
   - Updated to support both fixed questions and templates
   - Added isTemplate flag to identify templated questions
   - Support for templateText alongside regular text

4. **Question Generator**
   - Generates mentor variants from templates
   - Distributes questions across domains and mentors
   - Preserves mentor distinctiveness while improving content coverage

### Changes to Existing Components

1. **Activity Engagement**
   - Updated to handle both question formats
   - Improved support for different MultipleChoiceQuestion structures
   - Fixed compatibility issues with correctOptionIndices and isCorrect properties

2. **Question Types**
   - Converted from enum-based QuestionType to string literals
   - Updated related files:
     - QuestionFeedback.tsx
     - ActivityEngagement.tsx
     - questionStore.ts
     - questionLoader.ts
     - questionEvaluator.ts
     - challengeManager.ts
     - DebugPanel.tsx

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Content Scalability**
   - Questions can be authored once and presented by any mentor
   - Easier to ensure comprehensive domain coverage

2. **Preserved Mentor Distinctiveness**
   - Each mentor maintains their unique voice and personality
   - Domain specialists still have deeper technical language in their area

3. **Simplified Maintenance**
   - Less duplication of question content
   - Easier to add new questions across domains
   - Better separation of content from presentation
