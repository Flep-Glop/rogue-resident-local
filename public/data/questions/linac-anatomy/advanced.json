For the 1×1 cm field, the microDiamond detector would provide the most accurate reading because its near-water equivalence (Z≈6) minimizes density correction factors (within 1%), while its small active volume (0.004 mm³) minimizes volume averaging effects, and its disc-shaped geometry allows precise positioning within the field",
