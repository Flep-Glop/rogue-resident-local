To determine the 'true' output factors, I would implement a multi-detector approach using the daisy-chaining method with field-specific correction factors from TRS-483. This involves using each detector in its optimal range (microDiamond or plastic scintillator for smallest fields, diode for intermediate fields, and small ion chamber for larger fields), with appropriate correction factors (kQclin,Qmsr).

The 90% isodose wouldn't properly conform to the target depth, requiring higher energy that would expose underlying structures to ~20% of prescription dose. Bolus conformal therapy creates a custom bolus to provide constant SSD and stops electrons at the target depth using variable thickness. This improves dose homogeneity to ±7% and reduces deep dose to ~5% but requires complex fabrication with 0.5mm precision. MERT uses multiple intensity-modulated electron fields of different energies, creating the most conformal dose (±5% heterogeneity) with minimal deep dose (2-3%) through optimization of the energy spectrum but requires Monte Carlo-based planning and complex collimation that few centers can implement",

I would implement a three-tier protocol: Level 1 - Ion chamber array verification for all patients with 3%/2mm criteria and 98% threshold; Level 2 - Selected random sampling (25% of plans) with film or EPID using 2%/1mm with 90% threshold; Level 3 - Quarterly end-to-end testing with anthropomorphic phantoms including motion effects for critical techniques.
