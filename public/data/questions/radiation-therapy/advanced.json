This patient has two tumors: a prostate adenocarcinoma (α/β ≈ 1.5 Gy) and a head/neck squamous cell carcinoma (α/β ≈ 10 Gy). If we were to use a uniform hypofractionated approach of 3 Gy per fraction, explain the differential radiobiological impact on each tumor and the surrounding normal tissues in quantitative terms.\"",

        "correct": "Brilliant analysis! You've precisely quantified the differential radiobiological effects on tissues with varying α/β ratios and recognized the clinical implications. This mathematical relationship between dose per fraction and BED is precisely why hypofractionation has been adopted for prostate cancer but remains experimental for many head and neck cancers.",
        "incorrect": "The mathematical relationship between fraction size, alpha/beta ratio, and biological effect follows a specific pattern that impacts tissues differently based on their repair capacity. Let's reconsider the quantitative effects on tissues with different alpha/beta ratios."
