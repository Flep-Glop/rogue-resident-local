# Debug State Images

This folder contains sprite images for the debug state selector on the title screen.

## Required Images

- `before-desk.png` - Image representing the state right before the desk activity
- `before-cutscene.png` - Image representing the state right before the cutscene

## Image Specifications

- Recommended size: Any pixel art resolution that looks good in the grid
- Format: PNG with transparency support
- Style: Should match the game's pixel art aesthetic
- The images will be displayed in a 3x3 grid of boxes on the title screen

## Usage

When the "Test Activity" button is clicked on the title screen, a 3x3 grid appears. The first two boxes in the grid use these images and allow you to jump to specific game states for testing purposes.
